      <h2>What the EDI Is</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems are rapidly becoming the primary way people discover, evaluate, and interact with businesses. Yet until now,
        there has been no standard for understanding how clearly a business is interpreted and surfaced by AI models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> is a structured 0–100 assessment of how clearly and
        consistently AI systems can understand and surface a business entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not an SEO metric. It is not a marketing measure. It is a
        <strong>machine-comprehension standard</strong> designed for the AI era.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why the EDI Exists</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems rely on structured data, machine-readable context, entity definitions, metadata integrity, cross-source
        corroboration, and consistent naming and signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        But businesses have never had a formal way to measure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how understandable they are to AI</li>
        <li>how coherent their machine identity is</li>
        <li>whether AI models can reliably surface them</li>
        <li>where ambiguity, drift, or inconsistency is occurring</li>
        <li>whether their digital structure supports accurate AI interpretation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The EDI establishes the structural foundation required for businesses to be represented accurately in AI-led environments.
