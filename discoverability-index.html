      <h2>What the EDI Is</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems are rapidly becoming the primary way people discover, evaluate, and interact with businesses. Yet until now,
        there has been no standard for understanding how clearly a business is interpreted and surfaced by AI models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> is a structured 0–100 assessment of how clearly and
        consistently AI systems can understand and surface a business entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not an SEO metric. It is not a marketing measure. It is a
        <strong>machine-comprehension standard</strong> designed for the AI era.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why the EDI Exists</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems rely on structured data, machine-readable context, entity definitions, metadata integrity, cross-source
        corroboration, and consistent naming and signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        But businesses have never had a formal way to measure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how understandable they are to AI</li>
        <li>how coherent their machine identity is</li>
        <li>whether AI models can reliably surface them</li>
        <li>where ambiguity, drift, or inconsistency is occurring</li>
        <li>whether their digital structure supports accurate AI interpretation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The EDI establishes the structural foundation required for businesses to be represented accurately in AI-led environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Three Structural Pillars of the EDI</h2>
      <p>
        These pillars form the core dimensions of <strong>AI Discoverability</strong>. They define how AI systems interpret,
        understand, and surface businesses with clarity and consistency. We publish these three as the external-facing structure
        of the discipline.
      </p>

      <h3>Pillar 1 — Structured Data</h3>
      <p>
        The clarity, depth, and accuracy of the machine-readable information a business provides.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Schema</li>
        <li>Metadata</li>
        <li>Structured definitions</li>
        <li>Canonical identity fields</li>
        <li>Machine-friendly descriptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AI systems depend on structure to understand entities.
      </p>

      <h3>Pillar 2 — AI Readiness</h3>
      <p>
        How well a business’s digital presence aligns with the interpretive patterns AI models use today.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Naming consistency</li>
        <li>Conceptual clarity</li>
        <li>Signal coherence across sources</li>
        <li>Platform alignment</li>
        <li>Entity disambiguation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AI readiness strongly influences whether a business is recognised or misinterpreted.
      </p>

      <h3>Pillar 3 — Continuous Optimisation</h3>
      <p>
        Whether the business maintains a stable, reliable, and evolving machine identity as models and contexts change.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitoring drift</li>
        <li>Reinforcing corroboration</li>
        <li>Maintaining digital integrity</li>
        <li>Iterative alignment with evolving AI behaviours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AI systems evolve. Businesses need to evolve with them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Note on Completeness</h2>
      <p>
        The EDI contains additional internal layers that ensure the score remains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>robust</li>
        <li>consistent</li>
        <li>model-agnostic</li>
        <li>resistant to manipulation</li>
        <li>reflective of how modern AI systems process complex entities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These parameters remain proprietary to ensure the integrity, stability, and long-term reliability of the EDI as a
        machine-era standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this public overview reveals EntityWorks’ internal evaluation logic or weighting model.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What an EDI Score Reveals</h2>
      <p>
        An EDI score provides clarity on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how well AI systems understand the business</li>
        <li>how consistently the business is surfaced across models</li>
        <li>where ambiguity or misinterpretation may occur</li>
        <li>how resilient the machine identity is to model changes</li>
        <li>whether competitors are more “machine-ready”</li>
        <li>what structural improvements are required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is a <strong>diagnostic tool for machine-era visibility</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why the EDI Matters</h2>
      <p>
        As AI becomes the primary interface for discovery:
      </p>
      <h3>Businesses with unclear, inconsistent, or fragmented machine identities may:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>be misinterpreted</li>
        <li>be confused with competitors</li>
        <li>lose contextual relevance</li>
        <li>appear less frequently across AI interfaces</li>
        <li>experience reduced trust or discoverability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Businesses with strong machine identities are more likely to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>be understood</li>
        <li>be differentiated</li>
        <li>be surfaced correctly</li>
        <li>be consistently represented</li>
        <li>maintain visibility as models evolve</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The EDI enables businesses to strengthen these foundations proactively.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The EDI as Part of a New Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        The EDI is a foundational component of EntityWorks’ mission to:
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        <strong>Define, structure, and formalise the discipline of AI Discoverability.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the definition, the structured framework, the lexicon, the methodology, and the measurable standard,
        EntityWorks establishes the foundational model for how businesses prepare themselves for AI-first visibility.
