  <h1>About EntityWorks</h1>

  <p>EntityWorks exists because AI systems are now being relied upon by people and organisations who did not build them.</p>

  <p>As soon as that happens, informal explanations stop being sufficient.</p>

  <p>Shared reliance requires shared interpretive structure.</p>

  <p>When decisions, trust, coordination, or legitimacy depend on inferences drawn by AI systems from the totality of digital signals available to them, there must be a shared interpretive reference that remains stable across systems, contexts, and time.</p>

  <p>EntityWorks was created to provide that reference.</p>

  <h2>The Problem EntityWorks Addresses</h2>

  <p>AI systems increasingly act as interpretive intermediaries, shaping how people, organisations, relationships, and ideas are represented, surfaced, prioritised, or acted upon.</p>

  <p>However:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>those interpretations are rarely documented in a shared way,</li>
    <li>meaning drifts across systems and updates,</li>
    <li>and reliance emerges before interpretive structure does.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This creates a structural risk.</p>

  <p>People and organisations begin to depend on AI mediated interpretations that have no stable, external reference. Over time, this makes responsibility, comparison, and accountability difficult to establish and sustain.</p>

  <p>EntityWorks exists to resolve that risk by defining interpretive infrastructure where none previously existed.</p>

  <h2>How EntityWorks Operates</h2>

  <p>EntityWorks operates by originating interpretive frameworks and shared reference models, maintaining canonical definitions and criteria, issuing formal interpretive artefacts grounded in those frameworks, licensing the use of EntityWorks standards, instruments, and marks, and stewarding framework evolution over time.</p>

  <p>These artefacts document how entities are positioned within the published interpretive frameworks at a given point in time. They are descriptive and referential in nature, and do not express evaluation, endorsement, or judgement.</p>

  <p>These activities provide orientation, not instruction.</p>

  <p>They allow organisations, institutions, regulators, and system owners to act independently within a shared interpretive space. EntityWorks does not participate in those actions. It maintains the reference they act against.</p>

  <h2>EntityWorks as Interpretive Infrastructure</h2>

  <p>EntityWorks is a standards level interpretive infrastructure organisation that publishes neutral external reference frameworks for AI mediated environments. As AI systems increasingly generate answers, summaries, and comparisons about people and organisations as part of everyday interaction, organisational identity now appears within those systems as dynamically generated representations rather than fixed records retrieved from a single source.</p>

  <p>EntityWorks focuses on the specific point at which AI systems form, express, and revise such representations. It publishes formal reference material that makes visible how AI mediated interpretation occurs, providing a stable third party reference frame for reasoning about how entities are resolved by AI systems over time. EntityWorks does not operate at the level of execution or optimisation. It operates at the level of interpretive structure, supplying shared vocabulary, distinctions, and reference points that allow others to act independently within a coherent interpretive space.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>Every major technical shift eventually reaches a point at which shared reliance exceeds the capacity of informal explanation. When systems become embedded in decision making, coordination, and institutional processes, questions of interpretation can no longer be resolved implicitly or on an ad hoc basis.</p>

  <p>Markets stabilise only once shared classifications exist. Engineering systems interoperate only once standards are established. Governance functions only when responsibility can be referenced against a common interpretive frame. In each case, technical capability develops in advance of the interpretive structures required to rely on it consistently and over time.</p>

  <p>AI systems have now reached this stage. They are increasingly relied upon to generate and mediate representations that influence real world decisions, yet the interpretive conditions under which those representations are formed, compared, and relied upon are rarely documented in a shared or durable way.</p>

  <p>EntityWorks exists to define the interpretive layer that enables long term reliance on AI mediated representation, by providing stable reference structures through which meaning, responsibility, and comparison can be maintained across systems, contexts, and time.</p>

  <h2>The Role of EntityWorks</h2>

  <p>EntityWorks defines the interpretive conditions under which AI mediated representations can be understood, compared, and relied upon once they become consequential. Its role is not to direct behaviour or prescribe action. It ensures that reliance on AI mediated interpretation occurs within a coherent and externally referenceable structure.</p>

  <p>EntityWorks publications, standards, instruments, and artefacts provide interpretive reference only. They do not constitute advice, certification, approval, compliance determination, instruction, or endorsement. Their function is to stabilise meaning and responsibility in environments where interpretation is already occurring, independently of EntityWorks’ involvement.</p>
