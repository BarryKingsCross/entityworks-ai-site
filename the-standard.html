    <h1>The EntityWorks Standard</h1>
    <p><strong>Human-Facing Edition (v1.2)</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the Standard</h2>
    <p>
      AI systems form and express representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas. Describing these representations in a reliable and structured manner depends on clear terminology, well-defined conceptual boundaries, and coherent representational frameworks. The EntityWorks Standard provides the formal reference through which this discipline is organised and expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Standard is to present the EntityWorks formulation of AI Perception within a clear and formally structured framework. It sets out the definitions, conceptual structures, failure modes, risk and condition categories, evaluative and diagnostic constructs, analytical layers, contextual domains, declarative mechanisms, and terminology governance that together compose this formulation. These elements are organised to provide a consistent and interpretable reference for describing the discipline within the scope of the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Standard organises this material in a coherent form that supports stable reference, comparison, and interpretation, establishing the basis upon which related components of the discipline are documented and developed.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of the Standard</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard covers the components that constitute the EntityWorks formulation of AI Perception. These include the conceptual definitions that establish the discipline’s terminology; the structural frameworks that describe representational organisation; formally defined failure modes, risks, and conditions; evaluative, diagnostic, and analytical constructs; contextual domains in which AI-formed representations become consequential; declarative and transparency constructs relating to machine-facing surfaces; and the controlled terminology governing language use within the scope of the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Standard may also include machine-readable specifications designed to represent these components in formats appropriate for technical or interpretive use, where such representation supports clarity or reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Standard is limited to the formulation, structures, and constructs defined within its own scope and does not extend its jurisdiction beyond them. It does not prescribe system design, behaviour, mitigation, remediation, or enforcement. The Standard may be consulted wherever its terminology, structures, or representations are relevant to the work being undertaken.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Structure of the Standard</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard is organised into a set of structured components that together present the EntityWorks formulation of AI Perception. These components are arranged into a series structure, with each series addressing a distinct class of defined material within the scope of the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each series groups components according to their conceptual role, ensuring that definitions, structures, conditions, evaluative constructs, analytical layers, contextual domains, declarative mechanisms, and terminology governance are clearly distinguished. All series are non-operational and are limited to the descriptive, analytical, and representational scope defined by the Standard.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 D-Series — Conceptual Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      The D-Series contains the foundational conceptual definitions of the discipline. These definitions establish the core terminology and conceptual boundaries through which AI Perception and its directly related sub-disciplines are described within the Standard. The D-Series provides the primary vocabulary upon which all other components of the Standard depend.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 S-Series — Structural Frameworks</h3>
    <p>
      The S-Series presents the structural frameworks through which representational models are organised within the Standard. These frameworks describe how entities, relationships, and interpretive elements are structured and stabilised, defining the internal architecture through which the discipline is expressed.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 F-Series — Failure Modes</h3>
    <p>
      The F-Series contains formally defined failure modes describing conditions under which representational or interpretive behaviour departs from the structures articulated within the Standard. These components identify distinct failure phenomena without prescribing mitigation, remediation, or system behaviour.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 M-Series — Evaluative Components</h3>
    <p>
      The M-Series contains evaluative components used to signal or describe aspects of representational integrity within the scope of the Standard. These components define evaluative constructs and outcomes without asserting certification, compliance, or enforcement authority.
    </p>

    <h3>3.5 R-Series — Risk and Condition Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      The R-Series contains formally defined risk categories and representational conditions describing exposure, uncertainty, or default states arising from reliance on AI-formed representations. These definitions are descriptive and non-operational and are not classified as failure modes or evaluative outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>3.6 E-Series — Evaluative and Diagnostic Constructs</h3>
    <p>
      The E-Series contains structured evaluative and diagnostic constructs that support examination and interpretation within the scope of the Standard. These constructs define what is evaluated or examined without prescribing methods, thresholds, scoring mechanisms, or implementation procedures.
    </p>

    <h3>3.7 A-Series — Analytical and Observational Layers</h3>
    <p>
      The A-Series defines analytical layers concerned with observing and describing representational behaviour over time. These components establish analytical roles and relationships without performing evaluation, issuing signals, or mandating action.
    </p>

    <h3>3.8 C-Series — Contextual Domains and Boundary Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      The C-Series defines contextual domains within which AI-formed representations become socially, organisationally, or institutionally consequential. These components establish boundaries of relevance and consequence without asserting jurisdiction over system design, governance, or enforcement.
    </p>

    <h3>3.9 P-Series — Publishing and Declarative Constructs</h3>
    <p>
      The P-Series defines declarative and transparency constructs relating to machine-facing representational surfaces. These components establish shared acknowledgement and disclosure frameworks without mandating behaviour, implementation, or compliance.
    </p>

    <h3>3.10 T-Series — Terminology and Semantic Governance</h3>
    <p>
      The T-Series defines controlled terminology governing language usage within the scope of the Standard. This series establishes semantic governance for both human-facing and machine-facing representations of the material defined by the Standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of Section 3 now reads as structurally complete, intentional, and contemporaneous with Section 4, with no signal of later accretion and no dilution of standards posture.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Published Components of the Standard</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard includes a set of formally defined and published components that together constitute the EntityWorks formulation of AI Perception. These components are organised into the series structure defined above. Each series groups components of a distinct conceptual type within the scope of the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only components that have been formally defined, reviewed, and published are listed below. Additional components may be introduced in future revisions in accordance with the Standard’s governance and versioning procedures.

    <h2>5. Forthcoming Components</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard may be expanded with additional components where further definitions, frameworks, conditions, constructs, domains, or governance elements are formally developed within its scope. Any such components will be assigned to the appropriate series and published in accordance with the Standard’s versioning, review, and documentation procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      New material is introduced only when it has been formally defined, reviewed, and determined to be consistent with the conceptual boundaries and non-operational posture of the Standard. Publication is limited to components that meet the criteria established for inclusion within the Standard and does not imply implementation guidance, enforcement authority, or behavioural requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intended Users</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard may be consulted in contexts where structured descriptions of AI-formed representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas are relevant to the work being undertaken. It provides a formally defined set of terminology, structures, conditions, evaluative constructs, analytical layers, domains, and declarative elements that support consistent reference within the scope of the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers whose work involves conceptual modelling, technical systems, analytical methods, policy analysis, regulatory reasoning, or interpretive frameworks relating to representational behaviour may find the material applicable to their context. This includes, but is not limited to, technical practitioners, researchers, standards bodies, policy analysts, and other readers whose work intersects with the definitions and structures set out in the Standard.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Governance and Versioning</h2>
    <p>
      The Standard is maintained through an internal governance process that oversees its development, review, publication, and revision. Updates are introduced only when additional components are formally developed within the scope of the Standard and meet the criteria established for inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each component of the Standard is versioned and documented in accordance with established change-control procedures. Human-readable editions are published for reference, and machine-readable representations may be provided where structured representation supports clarity, consistency, or interpretive use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governance of the Standard is limited strictly to the material defined within it. Revisions do not extend the jurisdiction, scope, or authority of the Standard beyond its stated boundaries.
