    browsing this website.

  <h2>4. Voluntary Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose to contact us by email at
    <a href="mailto:hello@entityworks.ai">hello@entityworks.ai</a>,
    your message will be processed solely for the purpose of responding to your enquiry.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not add your details to marketing lists, share them with third parties, or use them for any
    purpose other than handling your enquiry.
