<h1>Privacy &amp; GDPR Notice</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated: December 2025</strong></p>

<p>
  EntityWorks Ltd (“EntityWorks”, “we”, “us”, “our”) operates
  <a href="https://entityworks.ai">https://entityworks.ai</a>. This website exists to publish the
  EntityWorks Standard and related institutional materials concerning the disciplines of
  AI Perception and AI Discoverability as they are defined within the EntityWorks Standard.
  The website does not collect behavioural data, personal identifiers, analytics, or tracking information.
</p>

<p>
  This notice explains what personal data we may handle, under what circumstances, and for what purpose.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>

<p>For the purposes of the UK GDPR, the data controller is:</p>

<p>
  EntityWorks Ltd<br>
  Registered in England &amp; Wales<br>
  Company No: 16849701<br>
  Registered Office: 82a James Carter Road, Mildenhall,<br>
  Bury St. Edmunds, England, IP28 7DE
</p>

<h2>2. We Do Not Collect Personal Data via the Website</h2>

<p>
  EntityWorks does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, process, or track any personal information from visitors who simply browse this website.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No cookies are set by EntityWorks</li>
  <li>No analytics or tracking scripts are used</li>
  <li>No user accounts or logins exist</li>
  <li>No server-side collection of behavioural data takes place</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your browser may store standard cached files to display pages, but EntityWorks does not access, process, or use this information.
</p>

<h2>3. Cookie &amp; Tracking Statement</h2>

<p>
  This website does not set or use cookies, analytics tools, advertising technologies, fingerprinting tools, or behavioural tracking mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
  No information is stored on your device by EntityWorks, and no third-party tracking services operate on this site.
</p>

<h2>4. Voluntary Contact</h2>

<p>
  If you choose to contact us by email at
  <a href="mailto:hello@entityworks.ai">hello@entityworks.ai</a>,
  we will process the personal data included in your message solely for the purpose of responding to your enquiry.
</p>

<p>
  We do not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>add your details to marketing lists,</li>
  <li>use your data for anything beyond your enquiry,</li>
  <li>share your correspondence with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Correspondence is retained only as long as necessary to manage and complete the exchange, after which it may be deleted or archived in line with normal business record-keeping practices.
</p>

<h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (Article 6 UK GDPR)</h2>

<p>
  If you email us, our lawful basis for processing your personal data is
  <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> — specifically, responding to an enquiry you initiated.
</p>

<h2>6. Hosting &amp; Technical Logs</h2>

  This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect minimal technical logs

</p>

<ul>
  <li>are processed solely by GitHub,</li>
  <li>are covered by GitHub’s own privacy policy,</li>
  <li>are not accessed, collected, or used by EntityWorks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  EntityWorks does not use hosting logs for analytics, profiling, or marketing.
</p>

  To exercise these rights, contact:
  <a href="mailto:hello@entityworks.ai">hello@entityworks.ai</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You may also lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you have concerns about how your data is being handled.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Notice</h2>

<p>
  We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The most recent version will always be published on this page.
