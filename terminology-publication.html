  <h1>Terminology Publication (v0.1)</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction &amp; Purpose</h2>
  <p>This publication sets out the controlled terminology used within the EntityWorks Standard.
  These defined terms establish a stable and consistent language for describing how AI systems interpret,
  structure, and express their understanding of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas within
  the parameters of the Standard.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this terminology is twofold:</p>

  <p>First, to ensure that all components of the EntityWorks Standard operate on a shared conceptual foundation.
  Clear and unambiguous definitions strengthen representational clarity, support consistent interpretive
  behaviour across systems, and provide a stable basis for evaluating representational quality and
  interpretive integrity.</p>

  <p>Second, to support machine-readable governance.
  AI systems rely on structural clarity, semantic precision, and consistently applied interpretive conditions
  to form correct representations.
  By formalising the terminology of AI Perception and AI Discoverability, this publication provides the
  conceptual scaffolding required for systems to interpret entities consistently, distinguish them accurately,
  and maintain representational stability over time.</p>

  <p>These terms form part of the foundational infrastructure of the EntityWorks Standard and underpin all
  related measurement frameworks, interpretive processes, and conformance assessments.</p>

  <h2>2. Scope &amp; Applicability</h2>
  <p>All definitions published here apply within the EntityWorks Standard.
  They govern the discipline of AI Perception, and its sub-discipline AI Discoverability, as those disciplines
  are defined by EntityWorks.</p>

  <p>These terms describe the representational structures, interpretive processes, and actor roles relevant
  to how AI systems form, update, maintain, and express representations of people, organisations,
  relationships, and ideas.</p>

  <p>This publication does not assert universal or regulatory authority.
  It defines terminology solely as used within the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

  <h2>3. Domains of the EntityWorks Standard</h2>
  <p>The terminology in this publication spans three domains.
  These domains reflect the foundational components of the EntityWorks Standard and describe how
  representational information is created, transformed, and maintained across AI systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Actor Terms</strong></p>
  <p>Actor terms describe the roles that emit, transform, or consume representational signals.
  These actors influence how information enters the interpretive pipeline, how it is reshaped or
  re-expressed, and how representations are ultimately interpreted or acted upon by both human and
  machine systems.
  Actor terms provide clarity about who or what participates in the representational ecosystem
  defined by the Standard.</p>

  <p><strong>Process Terms</strong></p>
  <p>Process terms define the operations through which representations are formed, updated, or expressed.
  They describe the interpretive and structural transitions that occur as signals move through different
  stages of model behaviour.
  These terms establish the conceptual and procedural sequencing required for consistent,
  auditable, and repeatable interpretive outcomes across systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Structure Terms</strong></p>
  <p>Structure terms describe the locations, formats, and organisational conditions in which representations
  reside and stabilise.
  They define the representational spaces, layers, and structural conditions that govern how AI systems store,
  relate, and maintain information over time.
  Structure terms anchor the Standard’s interpretive logic by specifying where representational meanings persist
  and how they maintain coherence across model updates and cross-system interactions.</p>

  <h2>4. Versioning &amp; Limitations (v0.1)</h2>
  <p>This is Terminology Publication v0.1.</p>

  <p>It includes an initial subset of defined terms from the EntityWorks ontology.
  Future versions will expand the set of definitions, refine the scope or wording where necessary, and document
  any changes made.</p>

  <p>Definitions may be revised in future versions if clarification is required or if the Standard evolves.
  Revisions will always be versioned, recorded, and made in a way that preserves conceptual continuity and
  interpretive stability across versions.</p>
