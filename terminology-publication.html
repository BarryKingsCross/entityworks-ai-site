<h1>Terminology Publication (v0.2)</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction &amp; Purpose</h2>
<p>This publication defines the controlled terminology used within the EntityWorks Standard. These terms establish a stable and consistent language for describing how AI systems form, structure, maintain, and express representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas within the scope of the Standard.</p>
<p>The purpose of this terminology is to provide a shared conceptual foundation across all components of the EntityWorks Standard. Clear and unambiguous definitions support representational clarity, enable consistent interpretive reference, and establish a stable basis for analytical, diagnostic, and evaluative constructs defined elsewhere in the Standard.</p>
<p>This publication also supports machine-facing semantic governance. AI systems rely on structural clarity, semantic precision, and consistently applied conceptual conditions to form and stabilise representations. By formally defining the terminology of AI Perception and AI Discoverability, as it applies within the EntityWorks Standard, this publication provides the semantic scaffolding required for consistent entity interpretation and representational stability across systems.</p>
<p>The terminology defined here forms part of the controlled semantic infrastructure of the EntityWorks Standard and underpins all related structural, analytical, and evaluative components.</p>

<h2>2. Scope &amp; Applicability</h2>
<p>All definitions published here apply within the EntityWorks Standard. They govern the discipline of AI Perception, and its sub-discipline AI Discoverability, as those disciplines are defined by EntityWorks.</p>
<p>These terms describe the representational structures, interpretive processes, and actor roles relevant to how AI systems form, update, maintain, and express representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.</p>
<p>This publication does not assert universal or regulatory authority. It defines terminology solely as used within the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

<h2>3. Domains of the EntityWorks Standard</h2>
<p>The terminology in this publication spans three domains. These domains reflect the foundational components of the EntityWorks Standard and describe how representational information is created, transformed, and maintained across AI systems.</p>

<p><strong>Actor Terms</strong><br>
Actor terms describe the roles that emit, transform, or consume representational signals. These actors influence how information enters the interpretive pipeline, how it is reshaped or re-expressed, and how representations are ultimately interpreted or acted upon by both human and machine systems. Actor terms provide clarity about who or what participates in the representational ecosystem defined by the Standard.</p>

<p><strong>Process Terms</strong><br>
Process terms define the operations through which representations are formed, updated, or expressed. They describe the interpretive and structural transitions that occur as signals move through different stages of model behaviour. These terms establish the conceptual and procedural sequencing required for consistent, auditable, and repeatable interpretive outcomes across systems.</p>

<p><strong>Structure Terms</strong><br>
Structure terms describe the locations, formats, and organisational conditions in which representations reside and stabilise. They define the representational spaces, layers, and structural conditions that govern how AI systems store, relate, and maintain information over time. Structure terms anchor the Standard’s interpretive logic by specifying where representational meanings persist and how they maintain coherence across model updates and cross-system interactions.</p>

<h2>4. Versioning &amp; Limitations</h2>
<p>This is Terminology Publication v0.2.</p>
<p>It contains a formally defined and reviewed set of terms used within the scope of the EntityWorks Standard. Inclusion of a term in this publication indicates that it has been stabilised for reference purposes within the Standard.</p>
<p>Future revisions may introduce additional terms or clarifications where required to preserve conceptual coherence or interpretive clarity. Any such changes will be versioned, documented, and introduced conservatively to maintain semantic continuity across versions.</p>
<p>This publication does not assert universal authority over terminology outside the scope of the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

<p><strong>F-1200 — Probabilistic Inference Collapse (PIC)</strong></p>
<p><em>Definition v0.1</em><br>
Probabilistic Inference Collapse is a representational failure mode in which accumulated interpretive uncertainty exceeds recoverable bounds, resulting in unstable, contradictory, or incoherent representations of an entity. This condition reflects a breakdown in interpretive stability rather than isolated error.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
To describe a class of failure affecting representational coherence in probabilistic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br>
Occurs within representational structures and cross-system interpretive dynamics governed by the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

<p><strong>R-2100 — AI-Mediated Representation Risk (AMRR)</strong></p>
<p><em>Definition v0.1</em><br>
AI-Mediated Representation Risk refers to the exposure that arises when AI systems generate, stabilise, or propagate representations of an organisation that are treated as authoritative or decision-relevant by third parties, regardless of organisational intent, endorsement, or control.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
To name a class of representational exposure arising from reliance on AI-generated representations.</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br>
Applies wherever AI-formed representations of an organisation are relied upon for evaluation, attribution, comparison, or decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-references:</strong> EntityWorks Standard, AI Interpretation and Reliance Domain, Output Origin Uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>R-2200 — Output Origin Uncertainty (OOU)</strong></p>
<p><em>Definition v0.1</em><br>
Output Origin Uncertainty describes a condition in which an observer cannot determine whether an output was produced by human independent thinking, by a generative AI system, or by an unobservable combination of the two.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
To name an epistemic condition affecting reliance on outputs where origin cannot be determined.</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br>
Applies to contexts where outputs are treated as evidence of human thinking or capability.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-references:</strong> AI-Mediated Representation Risk, AI Interpretation and Reliance Domain, EntityWorks Standard.</p>

<h3>E-Series — Evaluative and Diagnostic Constructs</h3>

<p><strong>E-3000 — Entity Discoverability Index (EDI)</strong></p>
<p><em>Definition v0.1</em><br>
The Entity Discoverability Index is a structured evaluative construct used to examine how effectively an entity can be identified, distinguished, and consistently interpreted by AI systems.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
To assess representational discoverability, clarity, and interpretive consistency within AI-mediated systems.</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br>
Covers machine-side identifiability, separability, structural coherence, and interpretive stability within the EntityWorks Standard.</p>
