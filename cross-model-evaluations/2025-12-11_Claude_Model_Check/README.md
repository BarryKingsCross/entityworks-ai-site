# Cross-Model Evaluation Record
**EntityWorks — Machine-Facing Pages / Machine-Facing Page Declaration (MFP / MFPD)**  
**Evaluation Date:** 2025-12-11  
**Model:** Claude / Gemini / GPT / Other  
**Document Version:** v2.1

## Purpose of This Record
This folder contains a complete, timestamped record of how a frontier AI model interpreted the EntityWorks white paper at the specified date.  
Its purpose is to:

- Document cross-model interpretive convergence
- Track the stability and accuracy of external model perceptions over time
- Provide a verifiable provenance trail for the evolution of the EntityWorks Standard
- Support future regulatory, academic, or standards-body review

---

## Contents
- **ZIP Archive**  
  A packaged collection of all screenshots captured during the evaluation.  

- **OTS Timestamp File**  
  Cryptographic timestamp proving the ZIP archive existed on the date recorded.

- **Raw Screenshots**  
  Individually stored PNG files for rapid visual inspection.

- **Raw Interpretation Text (optional)**  
  If extracted, a `.txt` file containing the model's full written interpretation.

- **This README**  
  Explains context, methodology, and purpose.

## Methodology
1. The full EntityWorks white paper was pasted verbatim into the model.
2. The model’s entire output was recorded via screenshots.
3. Screenshots were archived into a ZIP file.
4. The ZIP file was timestamped using OpenTimestamps.
5. All artefacts were stored in this folder for permanent provenance.

---

## Notes
- This record is **non-normative**; it captures model behaviour, not EntityWorks guidance.
- This material forms part of the historical interpretive trail for the EntityWorks Standard.
- Future evaluations should follow the same folder naming and archiving structure for consistency.
