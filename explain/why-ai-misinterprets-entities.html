  <h1>Why AI Misinterprets Entities</h1>

  <p>
    AI systems frequently produce descriptions of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas that
    appear coherent and confident, yet later prove incomplete, unstable, or inconsistent when relied
    upon across differing contexts. This behaviour is widely observed across consumer, enterprise, and
    institutional uses of AI systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is notable is not that such misinterpretations occur, but that they often persist. Corrections
    do not reliably resolve them, and different AI systems may produce materially different accounts of
    the same entity even when drawing from similar sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    This pattern is not anomalous. It reflects a structural characteristic of how AI systems form and
    maintain meaning.
  </p>

  <h2>What this phenomenon is not</h2>

  <p>
    AI misinterpretation is commonly attributed to surface-level causes such as insufficient data,
    poor prompt design, or limitations of a specific model. These explanations are incomplete.
  </p>

  <p>The behaviour described here:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>is not specific to any single AI model, vendor, or architecture</li>
    <li>is not resolved by increased training data or model scale</li>
    <li>is not primarily a prompt-engineering or optimisation issue</li>
    <li>persists across deployments, updates, and system versions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As a result, improvements in accuracy or fluency do not necessarily translate into stable or
    reliable understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>The structural source of misinterpretation</h2>

  <p>
    AI systems do not “understand” entities in the human sense. Instead, they form internal representations
    based on probabilistic inference across language, data, and contextual signals.
  </p>

  <p>These representations are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>indirect rather than referential</li>
    <li>probabilistic rather than stable</li>
    <li>updated through pattern reinforcement rather than correction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When an AI system encounters an entity, it does not consult a fixed internal model. It reconstructs
    a working representation from prior signals, contextual cues, and inferred associations. Over time,
    these reconstructions may drift, fragment, or conflict with one another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Misinterpretation arises when such representations are treated as stable or authoritative, despite
    lacking the structural conditions required for persistence and coherence.
  </p>

  <h2>Entity-level failure modes</h2>

  <p>
    Because AI systems operate at the level of representations rather than ground truth, small
    inconsistencies can compound. An entity may be partially correct in one context and materially
    distorted in another, without the system recognising the discrepancy.
  </p>

  <p>This creates entity-level failure modes in which:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>representations diverge across systems</li>
    <li>corrections fail to propagate consistently</li>
    <li>downstream decisions rely on incompatible interpretations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These effects become more pronounced as AI systems are relied upon by people and organisations who
    did not build them and cannot directly inspect how representations are formed.
  </p>

  <h2>Formal domain and boundaries</h2>

  <p>
    The structural causes described above are formally addressed within the discipline of AI Perception,
    as defined in the EntityWorks Standard and maintained by EntityWorks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within this framework, persistent AI misinterpretation is understood as a consequence of how AI
    systems construct, stabilise, and revise representations of people, organisations, relationships,
    and ideas.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page provides an explanatory account of the phenomenon only. It does not constitute operational
    guidance, evaluation criteria, implementation instruction, or remediation strategy. Formal
    definitions, scope, and boundaries are maintained within the EntityWorks Standard.
