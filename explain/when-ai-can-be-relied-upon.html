  <h1>When AI Can Be Relied Upon</h1>

  <p>
    AI systems are increasingly relied upon to inform decisions, explanations, and judgements across a
    wide range of contexts. In many cases, their outputs appear coherent, confident, and internally
    consistent, which encourages their use as reference points beyond the moment in which they are
    generated.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, reliance introduces a different requirement than usefulness. An output may be helpful or
    informative in one interaction while remaining unstable or misleading when treated as a basis for
    ongoing interpretation or downstream decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The question of when AI can be relied upon is therefore not a question of performance alone. It is a
    question of interpretive stability.
  </p>

  <h2>What reliance is not</h2>

  <p>
    Reliance on AI systems is often conflated with accuracy, fluency, or task success. These qualities
    are relevant, but they are not sufficient to support reliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    In particular, reliance is not established by high confidence in output. It is not guaranteed by
    apparent correctness in isolated cases. It is not assured by model scale, frequent updates, or
    alignment with user expectations. It is not equivalent to trust in the human sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, an AI system may perform well in narrow or repeated tasks while remaining unsuitable
    for reliance in contexts where continuity of meaning, consistency of interpretation, or
    accountability are required.
  </p>

  <h2>Reliance as an interpretive condition</h2>

  <p>
    To rely on an AI system is to assume that its representations of people, organisations, relationships,
    and ideas will remain coherent across time, context, and use. This assumption extends beyond the
    immediate interaction in which an output is produced.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI systems do not naturally meet this condition. As established, they form meaning through
    situational reconstruction rather than persistent understanding. Representations are assembled in
    response to context and may shift as that context changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reliance fails when these shifts are not visible to those depending on the system, and when outputs
    are treated as stable representations rather than context-bound interpretations.
  </p>

  <h2>The limits of performance-based assurance</h2>

  <p>
    Many existing approaches to AI assurance focus on output quality, benchmark performance, or error
    rates. While these measures are useful, they do not address the representational continuity required
    for reliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    An AI system may consistently produce plausible responses while silently varying its underlying
    representations. In such cases, performance appears acceptable, but interpretive alignment degrades
    over time or across settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    This gap explains why reliance-related issues often emerge only after deployment, when AI systems
    are used by people and organisations who did not build them and cannot directly observe how meaning
    is constructed.
  </p>

  <h2>Formal domain and boundaries</h2>

  <p>
    The conditions under which AI systems can be relied upon are formally addressed within the
    discipline of AI Perception, as defined in the EntityWorks Standard and maintained by EntityWorks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within this framework, reliance is treated as an interpretive property rather than a technical one,
    grounded in the stability and coherence of representations rather than output quality alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page provides an explanatory account only. It does not constitute operational guidance,
    evaluation criteria, implementation instruction, or remediation strategy. Formal definitions,
    scope, and boundaries are maintained within the EntityWorks Standard.
