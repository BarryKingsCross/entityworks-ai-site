      <h2>What Is the Entity Understanding Layer™?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Entity Understanding Layer™ (EUL)</strong> is a conceptual model describing the core behaviours
        modern AI systems use when they form an understanding of an entity — such as a business, organisation, or individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not describe a specific algorithm or vendor implementation. Instead, it provides a clear, neutral way to
        talk about <em>what we can reasonably infer is happening</em> inside any AI system that can reliably answer questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Who is this organisation?”</li>
        <li>“What does this company do?”</li>
        <li>“Is this the same entity as the one mentioned elsewhere?”</li>
        <li>“Should I mention this business in my answer?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The EUL is part of EntityWorks’ broader effort to formalise the discipline of <strong>AI Discoverability</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>The Six Behaviours of the Entity Understanding Layer™</h2>
      <p>
        The Entity Understanding Layer describes six core behaviours that, taken together, explain how AI systems
        interpret and work with entities.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Meaning Construction</h3>
      <p>
        AI systems first need to determine <strong>what an entity is</strong>. Meaning Construction is the process of
        turning raw information (text, schema, descriptions, metadata) into a coherent understanding such as
        “this is a B2B software company” or “this is a retail brand”.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Identity Embedding</h3>
      <p>
        Once the AI understands what the entity is, it creates an internal representation so it can recognise and
        reason about that entity later. This includes attributes (name, type, sector), relationships, and context.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Entity Corroboration</h3>
      <p>
        AI systems are exposed to many sources that may or may not be talking about the same entity. Entity Corroboration
        is how the system reconciles those sources, resolves ambiguity, and determines whether they align or conflict.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Semantic Stabilisation</h3>
      <p>
        As new information appears, AI systems need to avoid changing their understanding too aggressively in response
        to isolated noise. Semantic Stabilisation is how they maintain a reasonably stable picture of an entity over time.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Conversational Surfacing</h3>
      <p>
        Even if an entity is known, AI systems still have to decide whether to mention it in a particular answer.
        Conversational Surfacing is the behaviour that determines if, when, and how an entity appears in responses.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Trust Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, AI systems must decide how much confidence to place in what they “know” about an entity. Trust Resolution
        covers how they weigh different sources, favour corroborated information, and de-emphasise conflicting or low-quality signals.
      </p>

      <h2>How the EUL Relates to AI Discoverability and the EDI</h2>
      <p>
        The Entity Understanding Layer™ explains <strong>how AI systems internally process entities</strong>.
        The discipline of <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> focuses on how clearly and consistently a business presents
        itself to those systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> measures how well an organisation’s public footprint
        supports machine understanding. In simple terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>EDI</strong> evaluates the inputs AI systems receive about your entity.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Entity Understanding Layer™</strong> describes what those systems do with that information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, they form a complete mental model for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how a business shows up to AI, and</li>
        <li>how AI turns that presence into decisions, answers, and representations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Defining This Layer Matters</h2>
      <p>
        As AI systems become the primary interface between people and information, organisations are increasingly represented
        to the world through AI-generated answers, summaries, and recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a clear framework for the Entity Understanding Layer™ helps businesses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand why AI may misinterpret or overlook them</li>
        <li>identify where their machine-readable presence is causing confusion</li>
        <li>align their digital footprint with how AI systems actually process entities</li>
        <li>have a structured vocabulary for working with AI-era consultants and auditors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For EntityWorks, the EUL acts as the conceptual foundation beneath AI Discoverability and the EDI.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Using the Entity Understanding Layer™ in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        The EUL is a lens for asking better questions about how AI sees your organisation. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaning Construction:</strong> Is it obvious, in machine-readable form, what we are and what we do?</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Embedding:</strong> Are our name, descriptions, and key attributes consistent across sources?</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Corroboration:</strong> Do major references to our organisation agree, or do they contradict each other?</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Stabilisation:</strong> Are we changing our messaging so often that AI cannot form a stable picture?</li>
        <li><strong>Conversational Surfacing:</strong> When we test AI systems with realistic prompts, do we appear where we should?</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Resolution:</strong> Are we giving AI systems strong, credible, corroborated signals about who we are?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These questions turn a vague concern — “How do AIs see us?” — into a structured, diagnosable set of problems.
      </p>
