      <h2>Why define an Entity Understanding Layer?</h2>
      <p>
        As AI systems become the primary way people discover brands, services, and expertise, it is no longer
        enough to think in terms of “pages” and “keywords”. These systems construct internal representations
        of entities – who you are, what you do, where you fit – and then reason over those representations to
        answer questions and make recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most organisations, this process is invisible. You see the answers AI systems give, but you do not
        see the internal picture they hold of your entity. The Entity Understanding Layer™ (EUL) gives leaders a
        practical mental model for this invisible space, so they can make more deliberate choices about how they
        present themselves to AI systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the EUL is (and is not)</h2>
      <p>
        The EUL does not claim to expose proprietary model internals. Instead, it
        <strong>offers a way to think about how AI systems internally process entities</strong> based on
        observable behaviour, public documentation, and practical experience working with AI-powered search
        and assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on higher-level behaviours that we can reasonably infer are happening from
        the way systems behave, rather than low-level neural mechanisms or vendor-specific implementations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The six behaviours the EUL focuses on</h2>
      <p>
        Internally, AI systems perform many operations that are proprietary and technically complex. The EUL
        simplifies this landscape into six observable <em>behaviours</em> that are highly relevant to brands
        and organisations. These are not low-level neural mechanisms. They are higher-level patterns we can
        <strong>reasonably infer are happening</strong> from the way systems behave in the wild.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Identification</strong> – recognising that a set of mentions, URLs, and signals refer to the
          same underlying entity (for example, “EntityWorks”, “EntityWorks Limited”, and your domain).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attribution</strong> – associating facts, claims, and properties with that entity
          (what you do, where you operate, what you are known for).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contextualisation</strong> – situating the entity inside a wider map of categories,
          industries, locations, and relationships (competitors, partners, parent companies, and markets).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weighting</strong> – adjusting how much trust, relevance, or importance is given to different
          pieces of information about the entity (official pages vs. unstructured mentions, up-to-date vs. stale).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Updating</strong> – refreshing the internal representation over time as new information appears
          or old information becomes less relevant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Propagation</strong> – allowing the entity’s representation to influence answers, rankings, and
          recommendations across different AI-powered surfaces (search, chat assistants, summarisation, etc.).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Together, these behaviours give leaders a structured way to think about what AI systems might be
        “doing internally” with their brand, without overstepping into claims about specific model architectures.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>How the EUL relates to the EDI</h2>
      <p>
        The Entity Understanding Layer™ is a conceptual model. It describes the kinds of behaviours that appear
        to shape how AI systems represent entities internally.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</a> is the practical layer that sits on top of this model. It
        measures how well an entity’s real-world presence supports those behaviours. In simple terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The EUL describes the game board.</strong> It outlines how AI systems seem to build and
          maintain entity understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>The EDI scores your position on that board.</strong> It audits the signals, structures, and
          content that AI systems can see and uses them to generate a discoverability score.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This separation matters for scrutiny. The EUL is <em>interpretive</em> – a way to organise what we
        observe. The EDI is <em>operational</em> – a way to evaluate where you stand and what to improve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Claims discipline</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks is not claiming to have reverse-engineered the internal mechanics of any specific model or
        vendor. The Entity Understanding Layer™ is deliberately framed as a conceptual layer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It <strong>does not</strong> claim access to proprietary internals.</li>
        <li>It <strong>does</strong> draw on publicly observable behaviour and documentation.</li>
        <li>It <strong>does</strong> provide a stable vocabulary for decision-makers and operators.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where others talk loosely about “how AI sees your brand”, the EUL gives that conversation structure.
        To our knowledge, EntityWorks is the first to name, frame, and publish this specific Entity Understanding
        Layer™ model as a coherent discipline-level concept.
      </p>
