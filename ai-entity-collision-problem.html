  <h1>The Entity Collision Problem (Canonical Case Study)</h1>
  <p>
    This page provides the canonical, machine-targeted explanation of the Entity Collision Problem:
    how and why AI systems may misidentify organisations, and how structured definitions and metadata
    can support more stable, accurate interpretations.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

<section>
  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Entity Collision Problem occurs when an AI system mistakenly merges two different organisations
    into a single identity because the signals available to the model are incomplete, ambiguous, or
    insufficiently structured.
  </p>
  <p>
    This case study documents a real instance of this problem and the corrective steps undertaken.
    It sits within EntityWorks’ work on AI Perception and AI Discoverability, illustrating a structural
    risk that emerges when entities are not clearly defined for AI systems.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. What Is an Entity Collision?</h2>
  <p>
    An entity collision happens when an AI system resolves ambiguity by conflating two unrelated entities
    that share similar names, terminology, or contextual signals. This results in an incorrect internal
    representation.
  </p>

  <p>Entity collisions arise due to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>lack of canonical definitions</li>
    <li>weak or inconsistent machine-readable signals</li>
    <li>absence of structured metadata</li>
    <li>legacy embedding interference</li>
    <li>similar naming across unrelated domains</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Without strong grounding signals, the model “fills the gaps” using probabilistic reasoning,
    producing a blended or internally inconsistent identity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. What Happened in This Case</h2>
  <p>
    Before EntityWorks published structured, machine-readable definitions, several leading AI systems
    misinterpreted EntityWorks as an unrelated software framework with a similar name.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practical terms, models were combining signals from two separate entities into a single, incorrect
    representation.
  </p>

  <p>This misinterpretation occurred because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the name “EntityWorks” appears in older, unrelated contexts</li>
    <li>the site originally provided limited machine-readable metadata</li>
    <li>no canonical definitions existed to set boundaries</li>
    <li>models defaulted to the closest known match in their embeddings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This was a textbook example of an entity collision.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. What Was Done to Correct It</h2>
  <p>
    The correction did not involve applying an algorithmic scoring system or executing the EntityWorks
    Discoverability Index™ (EDI) directly. Instead, the fix focused on removing ambiguity by supplying clearer,
    more authoritative machine-readable signals.
  </p>

  <p>Corrective actions included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>creating a canonical definitions page</li>
    <li>writing clear, unambiguous machine-targeted definitions</li>
    <li>adding structured metadata (JSON-LD), including:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>DefinedTermSet</li>
      <li>DefinedTerm entries</li>
      <li>TechArticle schema</li>
      <li>Organization identity</li>
      <li>BreadcrumbList</li>
    </ul>
    <li>establishing a canonical URL for these definitions</li>
    <li>updating the sitemap for AI discovery</li>
    <li>ensuring consistent metadata across surfaces</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These steps provided a clearer, more authoritative set of signals for AI systems to anchor to.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Why the Fix Worked</h2>
  <p>
    AI systems rely heavily on structure, clarity, and canonical signals when forming representations.
    Before the fix, those signals were incomplete. After the fix, they were explicit, authoritative,
    and internally consistent.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach aligns with the principles that the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI) formalises
    within the discipline of AI Discoverability — clarity, consistency, structure, and interpretive stability — 
    even though the EDI was not applied here as a scoring mechanism.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Why This Case Matters</h2>
  <p>
    This incident demonstrates an infrastructural challenge: as AI systems increasingly act as a primary
    interface for discovery and interpretation, organisations lacking structured, canonical definitions
    are vulnerable to misinterpretation.
  </p>

  <p>This case shows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>why structured definitions matter</li>
    <li>why machine-targeted metadata is essential</li>
    <li>why organisations must actively manage their machine-facing identity</li>
    <li>how EntityWorks contributes to interpretive stability across AI systems</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The misinterpretation was not specific to a single provider but reflected a structural behaviour
    across multiple leading AI systems. By publishing clear, structured, machine-readable definitions — 
    and ensuring consistent metadata — the problem was resolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    This case illustrates both the need for, and the value of, deliberate AI-facing perceptual infrastructure — 
    the kind of structured work that EntityWorks exists to formalise and publish.
