    accessible documents that form part of, or relate to, the EntityWorks Standard published
    on this domain. By accessing this website, you acknowledge that you have read and understood
    the information set out on this page.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope of this notice</h2>
  <p>This notice applies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the EntityWorks website at <a href="https://entityworks.ai">https://entityworks.ai</a>; and</li>
    <li>any publicly accessible documents of the EntityWorks Standard and related institutional
      materials made available on this website.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It does not govern the terms of any separate contractual arrangements, services, or
    engagements that may be agreed between EntityWorks Ltd and any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Nature of published material</h2>
  <p>
    EntityWorks Ltd publishes the EntityWorks Standard and related institutional materials.
    The EntityWorks Standard is a technical and conceptual standard that sets out definitions,
    structures, and constructs for the discipline of AI Perception as it is defined within the
    EntityWorks Standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Related materials may include explanatory or informative publications concerning AI
    Perception, AI Discoverability, the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™, the Entity
    Understanding Layer™, the Entity Collision Problem™, and other concepts, in each case only
    as they are defined within the EntityWorks Standard or in clearly identified supporting
    documents.
  </p>
  <p>
    All such material is descriptive in nature. It is intended to document and explain the
    structures, definitions, and internal logic of the EntityWorks Standard and related
    institutional work. It is not intended to constitute professional advice, assurance,
    certification, or a recommendation to adopt any particular approach, implementation, or
    course of action.
  </p>

  <h2>3. No advice, assurance, or reliance</h2>
  <p>
    The EntityWorks Standard and the materials published on this website are not tailored to
    the circumstances of any particular organisation, system, or implementation. They should
    not be relied upon as a substitute for independent professional advice, technical
    assessment, legal review, or other specialist services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Publication of the EntityWorks Standard or related materials does not constitute:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>advice in relation to any specific deployment or operation of AI systems;</li>
    <li>assurance of model performance, behaviour, or risk;</li>
    <li>certification, accreditation, or a statement of conformance for any organisation,
      system, or product; or</li>
    <li>a guarantee that use of the EntityWorks Standard or related materials will produce any
      particular outcome.</li>

  <p>
    EntityWorks Ltd aims to ensure that the EntityWorks Standard and related materials are

    are evolving, and the Standard and its accompanying documents may be refined or expanded
    over time as part of formal versioning processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    EntityWorks Ltd makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties, whether express or
    implied, as to the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of any content made available on
    this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to issue new versions of the EntityWorks Standard and to update or
    revise supporting publications without prior notice. Where version identifiers are used,
    they indicate the sequence of publication and do not, by themselves, confer any particular
    status or guarantee.
