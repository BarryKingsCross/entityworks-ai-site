      <h2>What is AI Discoverability?</h2>
      <p>
        AI Discoverability is the discipline concerned with how AI systems understand, represent, and surface
        business entities when people ask questions, search, or seek recommendations through AI interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        It goes beyond traditional SEO, which is centred on human-driven search engines and page rankings.
        AI Discoverability focuses on whether AI systems can form an accurate, coherent internal representation
        of a business and reliably surface it in the right contexts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why AI Discoverability needed to be defined</h2>
      <p>
        As AI systems increasingly act as the “front door” to the internet, organisations face new questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What picture of our organisation do these systems hold?</li>
        <li>Are we being surfaced when we should be?</li>
        <li>Are we being confused with competitors or outdated information?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Until now, there has been no formal discipline that names, structures, and measures this space.
        EntityWorks defines AI Discoverability to give leaders a vocabulary and framework for dealing with it directly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The role of the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™</a> is the first structured 0–100 framework dedicated to AI Discoverability.
        It provides an assessment of how clearly and consistently AI systems can understand and surface a business entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EDI is not an SEO metric or a marketing vanity score. It is a <strong>machine-comprehension standard</strong> for
        the AI era, rooted in the structural signals that matter most for AI systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The role of the Entity Understanding Layer™</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="/entity-understanding-layer.html">Entity Understanding Layer™ (EUL)</a> is EntityWorks’ interpretive model for how AI systems appear to build and
        update their internal understanding of entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the EUL describes the patterns of identification, attribution, contextualisation, weighting, updating,
        and propagation inside AI systems, the EDI measures how well a given organisation supports those behaviours
        through its real-world presence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Discipline-level structure</h2>
      <p>
        By defining AI Discoverability as a discipline, EntityWorks brings together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A formal definition and scope</li>
        <li>The <a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™</a> as a measurable standard</li>
        <li>The <a href="/entity-understanding-layer.html">Entity Understanding Layer™</a> as an interpretive conceptual model</li>
        <li>An evolving <a href="/lexicon.html">Lexicon</a> of terms and concepts</li>
        <li>A methodology for practical audits and implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This combination turns a vague concern (“How does AI see us?”) into a structured domain leaders can act on.
