      <h2>What Is AI Discoverability?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> is the discipline of ensuring that a business or entity is clearly understood,
        consistently represented, and reliably surfaced by modern AI systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        It focuses on how models interpret entities — not just how humans search. That includes structure, consistency,
        source alignment, and how information about a business is synthesised into answers for end users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Formalising an Undefined Space</h2>
      <p>
        Before EntityWorks, AI Discoverability was a loosely used concept. It appeared in conversations and marketing copy,
        but there was no shared definition, no agreed framework, and no measurable standard for it as a discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        EntityWorks formalised AI Discoverability into a coherent discipline by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining its scope and purpose</li>
        <li>Establishing a structured framework and methodology</li>
        <li>Introducing a measurable standard through the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™</li>
        <li>Creating a consistent lexicon and set of principles</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> is the first structured, 0–100 framework for assessing
        how clearly AI systems understand and surface a business.
      </p>
      <p>
        It translates an emerging, hard-to-see problem into something measurable and actionable. The EDI incorporates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A discoverability score from 0–100</li>
        <li>Analysis across defined pillars of AI Discoverability</li>
        <li>Identification of contradictions and fragmentation</li>
        <li>Structured recommendations and a clear priority path</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The EDI is not just a scoring mechanism; it is the practical expression of AI Discoverability as a discipline.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Principles of the Discipline</h2>
      <p>The discipline of AI Discoverability rests on several core principles, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — AI systems must be able to interpret business information without ambiguity.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency</strong> — information about an entity should align across key sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong> — data should be organised in machine-readable formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Stability</strong> — representation should not drift unpredictably as models evolve.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These principles underpin the EDI and guide the methods EntityWorks uses to assess and improve AI Discoverability.
