  <h1>AI Meaning State (AMS) — Definition of Record</h1>

  <p><em>(As defined within the EntityWorks Standard)</em></p>

  <p><strong>Name:</strong> AI Meaning State (AMS)</p>
  <p><strong>Series:</strong> A-3200 — Analytical and Observational Layers</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Published — Definition of Record</p>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> v1.1</p>
  <p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2026</p>
  <p><strong>Owner and Custodian:</strong> The AI Meaning State (AMS) is originated, defined, and maintained by EntityWorks Ltd as part of the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

  <h2>Definition (Canonical — Definition of Record)</h2>

  <p>
    The AI Meaning State is the semantic meaning expressed by an AI system within the <a href="/system-attribution-boundary-definition.html">System Attribution Boundary (SAB)</a>, in response to a specific prompt, as presented at the point of user encounter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AI Meaning State describes the externally expressed semantic content attributable to the AI system’s own expressive contribution for a single interaction. It is defined independently of system internals, training data, probabilistic representations, implementation details, or user interpretation or belief.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition is authoritative and governs all use of the term AI Meaning State within the EntityWorks Standard. Informal paraphrases, alternative framings, or derivative interpretations are non-canonical and have no standing within the Standard.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of the AI Meaning State is to provide a stable analytical reference for describing the semantic meaning expressed by an AI system at the point of encounter, once system attribution has been established.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AI Meaning State enables consistent observation and discussion of AI-expressed meaning without asserting evaluation, correctness, intent, endorsement, obligation, or consequence.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>

  <p>The scope of the AI Meaning State is limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>meaning expressed within the System Attribution Boundary,</li>
    <li>for a single prompt–response interaction,</li>
    <li>at the point of user encounter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The AI Meaning State is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>prompt-specific</li>
    <li>externally observable</li>
    <li>non-persistent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It does not describe meaning across prompts, interactions, sessions, or time, and does not assume stability, continuity, or equivalence across variations in system state or input conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Conceptual Domain</h2>

  <p>
    The AI Meaning State operates within the discipline of AI Perception as an analytical and observational construct.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its concern is what meaning is expressed, not how that meaning is generated, validated, interpreted, relied upon, or acted upon.
  </p>

  <h2>Role Within the EntityWorks Standard</h2>

  <p>
    Within the EntityWorks Standard, the AI Meaning State functions as a semantic reference construct.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>applies only after the System Attribution Boundary has been established,</li>
    <li>describes the semantic content expressed within that boundary,</li>
    <li>provides input to downstream interpretive and risk-related analysis without performing those functions itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The AI Meaning State is descriptive, not evaluative. It introduces no new interpretive primitives and does not subsume or replace other components of the Standard.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Canonical Uses (Explicit Exclusions)</h2>

  <p>The AI Meaning State is not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a measure of truth, accuracy, or correctness</li>
    <li>a representation of user interpretation, belief, or perception</li>
    <li>a description of system internals or reasoning processes</li>
    <li>a disclosure, labelling, or compliance mechanism</li>
    <li>an ethical judgment or integrity signal</li>
    <li>a proxy for attribution, advertising, or responsibility analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Uses of the term that imply these functions are non-canonical.
  </p>

  <h2>Relationships to Other Standard Components</h2>

  <p>The AI Meaning State operates in relation to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/system-attribution-boundary-definition.html">System Attribution Boundary (SAB)</a> — which establishes the boundary within which the AI Meaning State is defined</li>
    <li><a href="/entity-understanding-layer-definition.html">Entity Understanding Layer (EUL)</a> — which governs how expressed meaning is interpreted and stabilised downstream</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The AI Meaning State does not perform attribution, interpretation, or evaluation; it supplies semantic description only.
