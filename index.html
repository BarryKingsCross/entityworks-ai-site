      <h1>EntityWorks</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>EntityWorks</strong> publishes and maintains the <strong>EntityWorks Standard</strong>. 
      Our work focuses on the discipline of <strong>AI Perception</strong> as it is defined within the Standard. 
      We provide clear structures and terminology for describing how AI systems represent 
      <strong>people</strong>, <strong>organisations</strong>, <strong>relationships</strong>, 
      and <strong>ideas</strong> within its scope. 
      We steward the Standard, oversee its ongoing development, and offer supporting material to help 
      organisations, practitioners, and regulators make effective use of the concepts it sets out.
    </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Our Role -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Role</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks maintains the Standard and oversees its ongoing development. We document the discipline of AI Perception as it is defined within the Standard, publish supporting explanations, and provide stable terminology for understanding representational behaviour in AI systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work includes versioning the Standard, refining its structure, and producing material designed for both human readers and AI models. These resources are intended to help organisations and institutions understand and apply the Standard where relevant to their work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Core Concepts -->
    <section>
      <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        Within the scope of the EntityWorks Standard, two definitions serve as the foundation for the disciplines it describes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Perception</strong> — the discipline concerned with how AI systems form, update, and express their understanding of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> — the discipline of ensuring that AI systems can correctly identify, understand, and represent people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        These definitions help establish the shared terminology used throughout the Standard and in the supporting materials that EntityWorks publishes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who This Is For -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks provides materials that may be relevant to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>organisations developing or overseeing AI systems that rely on structured representations of entities,</li>
        <li>regulators and policy bodies examining AI interpretive behaviour,</li>
        <li>practitioners and researchers working with representational systems,</li>
        <li>anyone wishing to understand the conceptual structures defined within the EntityWorks Standard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our documents are written to provide clarity, structure, and consistent terminology for organisations and individuals engaging with these ideas.
      </p>
    </section>
