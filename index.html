  <strong>EntityWorks exists to name and clarify how AI systems form, stabilise, and act upon representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas, so that this representational layer can be understood, discussed, and referenced with precision.</strong>
</p>
    <h1>The EntityWorks Standard</h1>
    <p>
      The EntityWorks Standard is a structured document designed to help digital publishers prepare their work for entry into AI systems. The Standard brings together definitions, frameworks, and conceptual tools that provide a structured reference for preparing digital material for entry into AI systems. Its focus is on the clear expression of intent in published material and on reducing interpretive gaps that arise when AI systems ingest and act upon that material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within its scope, the Standard addresses the structured preparation of information for AI systems. This includes the clarity of published material, the organisation of machine-visible content, and the use of transparent mechanisms that help reduce representational risk and support consistent interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machine-Facing Pages and the Machine-Facing Page Declaration form one part of this broader framework. These components are described within the Standard to help organisations classify, document, and disclose the use of pages that exist outside normal human-visible navigation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>EntityWorks</h2>
    <p>
      EntityWorks publishes and maintains the EntityWorks Standard. Its role is to steward the structures, terminology, and conceptual material that support clear and consistent preparation of information for entry into AI systems. EntityWorks oversees versioning, maintains the definitions and frameworks documented within the Standard, and provides explanatory material to help organisations and institutions understand and apply the Standard where relevant to their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the publisher of the Standard, EntityWorks is responsible for ensuring that its material remains stable, clearly documented, and accessible to those who rely on it. This includes managing updates, maintaining the organisation of the content, and supporting the long-term clarity and coherence of the Standard as it develops.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      The EntityWorks Standard sets out the conceptual foundations that support its framework. These include the terminology, structures, and interpretive tools that the Standard uses to organise its material. Readers can explore the Standard directly to understand how these concepts are defined and how they relate to one another within the wider document.

    <h2>Machine-Facing Pages & MFPD</h2>
    <p>
      Machine-Facing Pages are digital pages that exist outside a site’s normal navigation or human-visible structure. Because they are not commonly encountered by users, their purpose may not be immediately evident. The EntityWorks Standard provides terminology and a proposed structure to help organisations classify these pages and disclose their use clearly and consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Machine-Facing Page Declaration (MFPD) is a short statement that explains why an organisation uses Machine-Facing Pages and what those pages are intended to do. It makes the purpose of this material visible so that AI systems, regulators, and human stakeholders all understand the organisation’s entire digital publishing footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the EntityWorks Standard, the MFPD is documented as a voluntary transparency measure that organisations can use to support clarity and open communication when publishing material that is not typically encountered through a site’s human-facing structure. Within the Standard, the preparation and use of the Machine-Facing Page Declaration (MFPD) is documented as a transparency mechanism for describing the purpose and scope of machine-facing material within a digital publishing environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>
      The EntityWorks Standard may be relevant to organisations preparing digital material for entry into AI systems, regulators and policy bodies examining how such material is interpreted, practitioners and researchers working with representational systems, and anyone seeking clarity on the structures and terminology used within the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The material is written to support consistent understanding across these groups and to provide a stable reference for those engaging with its concepts.
