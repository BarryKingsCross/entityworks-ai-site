    <!-- INTRO / ORIGIN -->
    <section>
      <h2>Defining the discipline of AI Perception</h2>
      <p>
        As EntityWorks examined how AI systems form their understanding of people, organisations, relationships and ideas,
        it became clear that the area commonly referred to as “AI discoverability” had not been formalised into a defined
        discipline. The term was being used informally, without agreed principles, structure, or a coherent framework.
        From our exploratory work in this unstructured space, we began to understand that there was a clear and pressing
        need for reliable, consistent and standardised AI interpretation. EntityWorks was established to give this area
        definition, to clarify its underlying principles, and to build the perceptual structures that modern AI systems
        will rely on going forward.
      </p>

    <!-- AI PERCEPTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>AI Perception: How AI Systems Understand the World</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>AI Perception is the discipline concerned with how AI systems form, update, and express their understanding of entities.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        As AI systems move from simple document retrieval towards richer, entity-level interpretation, perception becomes
        the layer that determines how people, organisations, products and relationships are represented inside models. It
        shapes which attributes are noticed, how context is applied, and how meaning is carried across different systems
        and updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        EntityWorks works on AI Perception as a structural discipline — clarifying the concepts, language and frameworks
        that help AI systems form more stable and accurate understandings over time.

    <section>
      <h2>AI Discoverability: Making Entities Legible to AI Systems</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability is the discipline of ensuring that AI systems can correctly identify, understand, and
        represent people, organisations, relationships and ideas.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        It focuses on the practical conditions that make entities legible to AI systems: clarity, consistency, structure
        and alignment across signals and sources. When these elements are in place, models have a clearer basis for
        forming and expressing their view of an entity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong><a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</a></strong> translates
        these principles into a measurable assessment. It provides a structured way to review how AI systems currently
        interpret an entity and to highlight where its AI-facing representation could be strengthened.

    <section>
      <h2>Where EntityWorks Fits In</h2>

      <p>
        EntityWorks focuses on the point where these two disciplines meet in practice. The work includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>clarifying the principles of AI Perception</li>
        <li>formalising AI Discoverability as an applied discipline</li>
        <li>developing the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™</li>
        <li>introducing the Entity Understanding Layer™</li>
        <li>publishing machine-readable frameworks, language and examples</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        EntityWorks was conceived, built, and operates as an AI-native organisation — designed with machine comprehension
        in mind from the outset, and with human interpretation built on top of that foundation.

      <h2>Start an EDI Pre-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        If your organisation depends on being correctly understood when people ask AI systems about it, you can begin with
        an EDI pre-assessment.
