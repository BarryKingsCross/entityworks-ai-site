      <h2>What is AI Discoverability?</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> is the discipline of ensuring that AI systems can correctly identify,
        understand, and represent people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        As more questions, decisions, and recommendations flow through AI systems, being accurately understood by those
        systems has become an essential part of modern visibility. AI Discoverability focuses on clarity, consistency,
        structure, and alignment — the foundations that allow AI models to form a reliable understanding of who you are
        and what you offer.
      </p>

      <h2>Where EntityWorks Fits In</h2>

      <p>
        EntityWorks is helping define and advance the principle of AI Discoverability by bringing structure, language,
        and measurable standards to an area that previously lacked clear definition. Through research, modelling, and
        formalisation, EntityWorks provides organisations with a coherent framework for understanding and improving how
        they are interpreted by AI systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the centre of this work is the <strong><a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</a></strong> —
        a structured, 0–100 assessment that translates AI interpretation into a measurable and actionable benchmark.
      </p>
