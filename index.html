      <h2>AI Discoverability — The New Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        AI is becoming the <em>de facto</em> search interface. People ask for what they want; AI generates answers.
        Whether a business appears clearly in those answers increasingly depends on how well AI can understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI Discoverability is the discipline of ensuring that a business presents itself in a way that modern AI
        systems can interpret clearly and consistently.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="why-now">
      <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems now act as intermediaries between customers and information. They interpret data, summarise it,
        and return answers based on their understanding of an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        If AI cannot interpret a business clearly, that business becomes less consistently visible across
        AI-generated results. The EDI provides a structured way to understand and respond to that shift.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-is-edi">
      <h2>What the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ Is</h2>
      <p>
        The EDI is a structured assessment that measures how clearly and reliably a business can be understood by
        modern AI systems. It turns an emerging, hard-to-see problem into something measurable, structured, and
        actionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EDI provides a practical starting point for improving how a business appears in AI-driven environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="edi-pillars">
      <h2>What the EDI Measures — The EDI Pillars</h2>
      <p>The Index evaluates three structural factors that influence how AI understands an entity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structured Data</strong> — Foundational information organised and made machine-readable.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Readiness</strong> — Clear and consistent representation across key sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Optimisation</strong> — Maintaining clarity as AI systems evolve.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How the EDI Assessment Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>We analyse publicly available information from key sources.</li>
        <li>We apply the three EDI Pillars.</li>
        <li>We produce a <strong>Discoverability Score (0–100)</strong>.</li>
        <li>We generate a <strong>Profile Summary</strong>.</li>
        <li>We provide a <strong>Priority Path</strong>.</li>
        <li>We deliver <strong>structured recommendations</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="improvements">
      <h2>Improvements Businesses Can Consider</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarifying descriptions</li>
        <li>Improving consistency across sources</li>
        <li>Strengthening structured data</li>
        <li>Correcting contradictions and outdated information</li>
        <li>Reinforcing category placement</li>
        <li>Addressing representation drift</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="does-not-measure">
      <h2>What the EDI Does Not Measure</h2>
      <p>The EDI does not evaluate product quality, brand strength, marketing performance, financial health, or customer sentiment.</p>
      <p>It focuses solely on how well AI systems can understand and surface the business.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="claims-discipline">
      <h2>Claims Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks maintains strict standards for the EDI. All statements are verifiable, truthful, proportionate,
        non-absolute, and non-misleading.
      </p>
