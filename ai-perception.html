        <strong>AI Perception is the discipline concerned with how AI systems form, update, and express their understanding of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It focuses on the internal representations that modern AI systems create — the way entities are modelled,
        connected, and updated over time. AI Perception sits above applied areas such as AI Discoverability and provides
        the conceptual structure for understanding how AI systems “see” and describe people, organisations, products, and
        relationships.
      </p>

      <h2>What AI Perception Covers</h2>
      <p>
        As AI systems move beyond simple document retrieval, they increasingly operate at the level of entities and
        relationships. AI Perception examines questions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how AI systems construct and store their internal understanding of entities</li>
        <li>how new information changes those internal representations over time</li>
        <li>which signals models treat as reliable when updating their view</li>
        <li>how different AI systems can diverge in their perception of the same entity</li>
        <li>how those internal views are expressed back to people in answers, summaries, or recommendations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By treating perception as a discipline, EntityWorks aims to bring structure to how these questions are asked and
        answered — so that AI systems can form more stable, accurate, and interpretable understandings of the entities
        they describe.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Perception and AI Discoverability</h2>
      <p>
        Within this broader discipline, <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> addresses a specific applied question:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability is the discipline of ensuring that AI systems can correctly identify, understand, and represent people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While AI Perception is concerned with how AI systems form and update their understanding internally, AI
        Discoverability focuses on whether those systems are given the right conditions — clarity, consistency, structure
        and alignment of signals — to form that understanding in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read more about how EntityWorks has formalised AI Discoverability as an applied discipline in
        <a href="/defining-ai-discoverability.html">AI Discoverability: Defining the Discipline</a>.

      <h2>EntityWorks’ Role in AI Perception</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks approaches AI Perception as a structural discipline. The work includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>defining the core concepts and language of AI Perception</li>
        <li>mapping how AI systems build and update their internal views of entities</li>
        <li>formalising AI Discoverability as a subdiscipline concerned with legibility to AI systems</li>
        <li>developing the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ as a measurable lens on AI-facing representation</li>
        <li>introducing the Entity Understanding Layer™ as a way to describe the structures AI rely on to interpret entities</li>
        <li>publishing machine-readable frameworks that help align human intentions with AI interpretations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, this page will serve as the hub for EntityWorks’ publications on AI Perception — connecting the
        underlying theory, the applied disciplines that sit beneath it, and the standards that support AI-era
        interpretation in practice.
