        <strong>AI Perception</strong> is the discipline concerned with how AI systems form, update, and express their
        understanding of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.

      <p>
        This page will become the central hub for EntityWorks’ work on AI Perception — the overarching discipline that
        sits above AI Discoverability. It will introduce the principles, models, and frameworks that describe how AI
        systems build and update their internal representations, and how that perception shapes what people see in
        AI-generated answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full publications will be added here as the discipline is developed and formalised.
