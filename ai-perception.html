  <h1>AI Perception</h1>
  <p><strong>Human-Facing Edition (v1.2)</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Canonical Definition of the Discipline</h2>
  <p>
    AI Perception is the discipline concerned with how AI systems form, maintain, and express their understanding of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the EntityWorks Standard, AI Perception defines the conceptual structures and interpretive boundaries used to describe how entities are represented inside AI systems and how that representational understanding may be surfaced in outputs. The discipline applies only as formally defined within the Standard and does not claim scope beyond it.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Scope and Authority Within the EntityWorks Standard</h2>
  <p>
    AI Perception functions as the conceptual representational layer of the EntityWorks Standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    It establishes the language, scope, and interpretive frame through which representational behaviour is described and analysed across all downstream components of the Standard. This includes the way entities are identified, differentiated, stabilised, and referenced within AI-mediated systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The discipline is model-agnostic and does not depend on any specific architecture, training method, or deployment context. Its authority derives from definitional clarity rather than implementation detail, and it exists to provide a stable conceptual reference for representational analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Core Representational Concerns</h2>
  <p>Within the scope of the EntityWorks Standard, AI Perception addresses a defined set of representational concerns:</p>

  <p><strong>Formation of entity representations</strong><br>
  How AI systems establish internal representations of people, organisations, relationships, or ideas.</p>

  <p><strong>Representational stability</strong><br>
  The degree to which these representations remain coherent over time and across interpretive contexts.</p>

  <p><strong>Distinguishability</strong><br>
  How AI systems maintain separation between similar, related, or overlapping entities.</p>

  <p><strong>Expression of understanding</strong><br>
  The structures through which internal representations are surfaced in responses, classifications, or other outputs.</p>

  <p>
    These concerns define the analytical problem space of the discipline. They do not prescribe how systems should behave, but provide a structured vocabulary for describing how representational behaviour occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Temporal and Interpretive Context</h2>
  <p>
    AI Perception is grounded in the recognition that AI systems now operate with persistent internal representations rather than ephemeral, one-off interpretations.
  </p>
  <p>
    As AI-mediated systems increasingly accumulate, reinforce, and update their understanding of entities over time, representational behaviour becomes a structural property rather than a transient effect. Interpretive states may persist across interactions, contexts, and deployments, introducing continuity, drift, or compounding effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The discipline of AI Perception exists to describe this temporal and interpretive reality. It treats representational persistence and evolution as first-class considerations, without asserting control over external systems or outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Explicit Non-Claims and Boundary Conditions</h2>
  <p>AI Perception, as defined within the EntityWorks Standard, makes no claims and asserts no authority in the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI model internals, architectures, or training processes</li>
    <li>Optimisation, performance tuning, or ranking improvement</li>
    <li>Behavioural prediction or outcome enforcement</li>
    <li>Compliance mandates, certification schemes, or regulatory authority</li>
    <li>Prescriptive guidance for system design or deployment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These boundaries are intentional. They preserve the discipline as a descriptive and interpretive framework, preventing collapse into tooling, optimisation, or governance mechanisms beyond its defined scope.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Relationship to EntityWorks Components</h2>
  <p>AI Perception forms the conceptual foundation upon which the EntityWorks Standard is organised.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The EntityWorks Standard</strong> provides the formal structure, series organisation, and governance framework.</li>
    <li><strong>Publications</strong> elaborate, analyse, and operationalise aspects of the discipline through structured expositions.</li>
    <li><strong>Entity Understanding Layer (EUL)</strong> articulates representational architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Entity Discoverability Index (EDI)</strong> evaluates aspects of representational clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>EntityWorks Analytics (EWA)</strong> analyses representational conditions over time.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Perception Integrity Mark (AIPM)</strong> signals conformance within the Standard’s scope.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each component operates downstream of the discipline definition and remains bounded by it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Intended Audience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>regulators and oversight bodies examining representational behaviour in AI systems,</li>
    <li>organisations deploying AI systems that interact with real-world entities,</li>
    <li>governance and compliance teams assessing representational stability,</li>
    <li>technical and research groups working with interpretive or entity-centric models.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The material is definitional and structural. It exists to support clarity, not to instruct or persuade.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Canonical References</h2>
  <p>Readers seeking further detail may consult:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The EntityWorks Standard</strong> — for formal structure, series organisation, and governance</li>
    <li><strong>Publications</strong> — for detailed analytical, evaluative, and structural expositions</li>
    <li><strong>For Regulators</strong> — for oversight-focused contextual material</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Together, these resources constitute the formal articulation of the discipline of AI Perception within EntityWorks.
