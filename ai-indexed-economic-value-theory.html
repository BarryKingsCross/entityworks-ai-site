  <h1>AI-Indexed Economic Value Theory™ — Defining the Discipline</h1>
  <p><em>EntityWorks — formalising how economic value forms in AI-mediated environments.</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    AI-Indexed Economic Value Theory™ explains
    <strong>how economic value is created, distributed, and perceived when AI systems mediate market understanding and decision-making</strong>.
    AI shapes perception, and perception shapes demand, trust, and comparative preference —
    <strong>and these forces influence price</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Why the Discipline Was Needed</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional value theory assumes humans perform discovery, comparison, and interpretation. These assumptions no longer hold.
    AI systems now compress information, rank options, and influence sentiment — reshaping how markets behave.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Core Purpose of the Discipline</h2>
  <p><strong>How does value change when AI becomes the first interpreter?</strong></p>
  <p>This discipline exposes the hidden economic mechanics introduced by AI as a market intermediary.</p>

  <h2>4. Foundational Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI-Mediated Discovery</strong> — Markets begin with AI responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretive Value Formation</strong> — AI influences perceived quality and relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility as a Pricing Variable</strong> — Clarity drives opportunity.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural Risk &amp; Distortion</strong> — Misinterpretation creates economic drag.</li>
    <li><strong>Semantic Advantage</strong> — Coherent entities gain favourable representation.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Indexed Competition</strong> — Competition shifts to the perceptual layer.</li>
    <li><strong>Perception-to-Price Transmission</strong> — AI shapes perceived value; perceived value shapes price.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How the Discipline Operates</h2>

  <h3>Mechanism 1: AI as Gatekeeper of Opportunity</h3>
  <p>AI determines which entities are surfaced, recommended, or framed as authoritative.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 2: AI as Market Comparator</h3>
  <p>AI performs comparisons that used to require human evaluation.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 3: AI as Trust-Assigning Agent</h3>
  <p>AI-generated summaries influence hiring, pricing, investment, and public trust.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 4: AI as Reputation Arbiter</h3>
  <p>AI’s summarisation becomes the default representation many entities live with.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 5: AI as Market Memory</h3>
  <p>AI retains long-term patterns; clarity compounds, ambiguity decays.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 6: AI as Signal Amplifier</h3>
  <p>Clear entities benefit from positive perceptual feedback loops.</p>

  <h3>Mechanism 7: Perception-to-Price Causality</h3>
  <p>
    AI influences visibility, trust, comparisons, risk interpretation, and narrative framing —
    all of which affect demand, behaviour, investment flows, and pricing power.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Relationship to AI Perception, AI Discoverability &amp; Corporate Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    This discipline sits at the macro-economic tier of the EntityWorks framework, describing how markets respond to AI-mediated perception.
    It is closely related to
    <a href="/lexicon.html#ai-perception">AI Perception</a> and
    <a href="/lexicon.html#ai-discoverability">AI Discoverability</a>,
    and to the structural work described in AI-Native Corporate Architecture™.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Implications for Markets &amp; Value</h2>
  <p>AI-indexed value will shape valuations, pricing power, hiring, partnerships, and leadership across sectors.</p>

  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    AI-Indexed Economic Value Theory™ formalises the macro-economic mechanics of the AI era.
    EntityWorks develops this discipline as part of the perceptual infrastructure defining how future markets operate.
