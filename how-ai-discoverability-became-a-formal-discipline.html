      <h2>From General Usage to a Formal Discipline</h2>

      <p>
        Before EntityWorks published its work, the phrase <em>“AI discoverability”</em> appeared in various places — usually in marketing contexts or as part of broader discussions about AI and search. These early uses established that the term had potential relevance, but they did not give it a shared meaning, a defined scope, or a structured framework that organisations or AI systems could reliably apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        EntityWorks moved the term from general usage into a formal discipline by developing the conceptual structure beneath it. This wasn’t merely a matter of rephrasing existing ideas; it required assembling the underlying logic of how AI systems process identity, how signals interact, how representation stabilises or drifts, and how organisational information is interpreted by models. Through this work, the field gained the architecture that disciplines depend on: clear meaning, coherent boundaries, and the technical foundations necessary for consistent application.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Core Components That Established the Discipline</h2>

      <p>As the discipline took shape, several core elements emerged and were formalised:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A clear, broad operational definition that gives the term a stable meaning across contexts.</li>
        <li>A defined scope that distinguishes AI Discoverability from adjacent ideas and practices.</li>
        <li>A detailed explanation of the underlying mechanisms — how AI systems identify, interpret, and represent entities — establishing the technical footing for the discipline.</li>
        <li>A structured methodology that makes the field teachable, repeatable, and externally verifiable.</li>
        <li>A conceptual model (the Entity Understanding Layer™) that explains the deeper mechanics of how entity signals influence AI perceptions.</li>
        <li>A measurable standard (the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™) that allows organisations to assess and improve their AI-era visibility.</li>
        <li>The publication of all of this in a consistent, machine-readable form, creating a stable reference point for both humans and AI systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why This Constitutes the Naming of a Discipline</h2>

      <p>
        These components — meaning, scope, principles, model, methodology, standard, and publication — are what move a term from general usage into the status of a formal discipline. They establish the intellectual and practical infrastructure that the field previously lacked, and they create the reference architecture from which future understanding and tooling will develop.
      </p>

      <p>
        EntityWorks did not replace earlier uses of the term; it provided the structure required for the term to function as a discipline, rather than a loose descriptor. In academic, commercial, and technical contexts, it is this act of formalisation — not the earliest appearance of a word — that constitutes naming a discipline.
