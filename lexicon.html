      <h2>Core Terms</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>AI Discoverability</dt>
        <dd>
          The discipline concerned with how clearly and consistently AI systems can understand, interpret,
          and surface a business or entity.
        </dd>

        <dt>Machine-Legibility</dt>
        <dd>
          The degree to which a business’s information is structured, unambiguous, and readable by AI systems,
          independent of how it appears to humans.
        </dd>

        <dt>Entity Clarity</dt>
        <dd>
          How confidently an AI system can determine what an organisation is, what it does, and what it offers
          based on available information.
        </dd>

        <dt>Entity Understanding Layer™</dt>
        <dd>
          EntityWorks’ interpretive model for how AI systems appear to build and update their internal understanding
          of entities. Instead of exposing proprietary internals, it organises observable behaviour into six
          higher-level patterns we can reasonably infer are happening:
          Identification, Attribution, Contextualisation, Weighting, Updating, and Propagation. Together, these
          behaviours offer a structured way to think about how AI systems internally process entities and allow
          leaders to reason about “how AI sees us” without overstating claims about any specific model.
          See <a href="/entity-understanding-layer.html">EUL overview</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Representation Drift</dt>
        <dd>
          The gradual divergence between how a business describes itself and how AI systems come to describe it over time.
        </dd>

        <dt>Claims Discipline</dt>
        <dd>
          The practice of ensuring that all statements about AI Discoverability, the EntityWorks
          Discoverability Index™ (EDI), and related outcomes remain verifiable, proportionate, and non-misleading.
        </dd>

        <dt>Structured Data</dt>
        <dd>
          Information expressed in machine-readable formats (such as schema.org JSON-LD, metadata, or well-formed tables)
          that helps AI systems reliably interpret entities.
        </dd>

        <dt>AI Readiness</dt>
        <dd>
          The extent to which a business’s public footprint is clear, up to date, and aligned across the key sources
          AI systems rely on.
        </dd>

        <dt>Continuous Optimisation</dt>
        <dd>
          The ongoing process of monitoring and adjusting a business’s machine-legible presence as AI systems,
          models, and information sources evolve.
        </dd>

        <dt>Discoverability Score (0–100)</dt>
        <dd>
          A composite score indicating how clearly AI systems can understand and surface a business or entity,
          as measured by the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™.
        </dd>

        <dt>EDI Pillars</dt>
        <dd>
          The three structural dimensions used by the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™:
          (1) Structured Data, (2) AI Readiness, and (3) Continuous Optimisation.
        </dd>

        <dt>Profile Summary</dt>
        <dd>
          A concise narrative describing how AI systems currently perceive and present a business, based on EDI findings.
        </dd>

        <dt>Priority Path</dt>
        <dd>
          A sequenced set of recommendations designed to improve a business’s Discoverability Score in the most efficient
          and impactful order.
        </dd>

        <dt>Presence Stack™</dt>
        <dd>
          A layered model describing the components that shape how AI systems see, interpret, and prioritise a business’s
          presence across the digital environment.
        </dd>

        <dt>Inter-Source Alignment</dt>
        <dd>
          The level of consistency between multiple public sources (such as websites, profiles, directories, and knowledge graphs)
          when they describe the same organisation.
        </dd>

        <dt>Semantic Integrity</dt>
        <dd>
          The preservation of meaning across different descriptions, channels, and formats, so that AI systems receive
          a coherent picture of the business.
        </dd>

        <dt>Entity Surface Area</dt>
        <dd>
          The total volume and diversity of information about a business that is available for AI systems to ingest,
          including both structured and unstructured data.
        </dd>

        <dt>Category Creation</dt>
        <dd>
          The act of defining, naming, and formalising a discipline or field where no coherent, shared structure
          previously existed.
        </dd>

        <dt>Entity-Coherence Score</dt>
        <dd>
          An internal metric concept for assessing how uniformly and consistently a business is represented
          across AI-indexed sources.
        </dd>

        <dt>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</dt>
        <dd>
          A structured, measurable framework for assessing AI Discoverability and generating a Discoverability Score,
          Profile Summary, and Priority Path for a business. The EDI sits on top of the patterns described in the
          Entity Understanding Layer™, translating them into a practical 0–100 assessment. See
          <a href="/discoverability-index.html">EDI overview</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Legacy SEO</dt>
        <dd>
          A shorthand for traditional, search-engine-focused optimisation practices that prioritise human search results
          and rankings rather than AI interpretation and machine-legibility.
        </dd>
