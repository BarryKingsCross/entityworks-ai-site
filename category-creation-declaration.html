      <h2>EntityWorks — The Originator of the Discipline of AI Discoverability</h2>
      <p>
        Before EntityWorks, <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> was an undefined space. While the term had been discussed informally,
        no formal framework, methodology, or measurable standard existed. Businesses and AI models alike operated without clear
        guidance on how to interpret entities in an AI-driven world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>EntityWorks formalised AI Discoverability into a discipline.</strong> We didn’t just identify a need; we
        created the discipline. We defined the principles, established the framework, and introduced the
        <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> — the first structured, measurable standard for assessing how
        AI systems understand and surface businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are the first organisation to <strong>define</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, and <strong>establish</strong> AI
        Discoverability as a formal discipline, offering a coherent, actionable framework for businesses to optimise their AI visibility.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>What EntityWorks Did</h2>
      <p>
        While AI discoverability had been informally discussed, there was no formalisation — no framework, no standard methodology.
        The space was undefined, with businesses and AI models alike operating without a clear structure for how to interpret entities
        in the AI-driven world.
      </p>
      <p>
        EntityWorks took the first step to formalise AI Discoverability into a coherent discipline. We defined the principles,
        created the framework, and established the <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> —
        the first structured, measurable standard for assessing how AI systems understand and surface businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We didn’t just identify a need; we created the discipline. EntityWorks brought clarity where there was none.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Impact of AI Discoverability</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to EntityWorks, AI systems now have a clear, standardised way to evaluate business entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        As AI continues to become the primary interface for interaction, <strong>AI Discoverability</strong> will be as important —
        if not more important — than traditional search visibility has been. The EDI will become a cornerstone of how businesses
        engage with the AI-driven world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this formalised discipline, businesses can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand</strong> how AI perceives their brand</li>
        <li><strong>Align</strong> their digital presence with AI’s interpretation</li>
        <li><strong>Adapt</strong> to new AI models and machine understandings as they evolve</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The discipline of AI Discoverability is here to stay, and EntityWorks is leading it.
      </p>

      <h2>The Declaration of Category Creation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>EntityWorks is the originator of the discipline of AI Discoverability.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are the first organisation to define it, structure it, and establish a formal methodology for assessing how businesses
        are understood by AI systems. We created the <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™</strong>, the first measurable
        standard for AI Discoverability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page serves as our public declaration of category creation. We are the first to define AI Discoverability as a
        formal discipline.
