      <h2>EntityWorks — The Origin Point of AI Discoverability</h2>

      <p><strong>Before EntityWorks, “AI discoverability” had no formal definition, no structure, and no standard. It was an unshaped intuition about how AI systems might surface information.</strong></p>

      <p>EntityWorks provided that structure.</p>

      <p>
        We formalised AI Discoverability into a discipline by defining its principles, setting its boundaries,
        and establishing the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI) as the first measurable framework for how AI systems
        understand and represent business entities.<br>
        <strong>With this work, EntityWorks provided the full foundations required for a new discipline:
        a defined problem space, a structured vocabulary, clear boundaries, a measurable standard,
        and an operational method.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>This work gives AI models a coherent way to interpret entities, and it gives organisations a practical method
        for improving how they are interpreted in an AI-led environment.</p>

    </section>

      <h2>Why AI Discoverability Matters</h2>

      <p>As AI becomes the primary interface between people and information, the ability for an organisation to be
      accurately understood by these systems becomes critical.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>See how AI interprets their identity and offer</li>
        <li>Strengthen the clarity and structure of their digital presence</li>
        <li>Adapt confidently as model behaviour evolves</li>
      </ul>

      <p>AI Discoverability is not a trend. It is an infrastructure shift — from being found by humans to being understood by machines.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Category Declaration</h2>

      <p>EntityWorks is the organisation that defined AI Discoverability as a formal discipline.
      We introduced the first structured methodology, the first measurable standard, and the first operational framework for it.</p>

      <p>This page stands as the category declaration:<br>
      <strong>AI Discoverability begins here.</strong></p>
