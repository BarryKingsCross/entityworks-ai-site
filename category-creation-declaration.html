      <h2>EntityWorks — The Origin Point of the Formal Discipline of AI Discoverability</h2>

      <p>
        Before EntityWorks, “AI discoverability” had no formal definition anchored in a discipline, no structured framework,
        and no standard. It was treated more as an intuition about how AI systems might surface information than as a field
        with its own principles, boundaries, and methods. By formalising AI Discoverability, EntityWorks has provided the
        structure that turns that intuition into a discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>AI Discoverability is the discipline of ensuring that AI systems can correctly identify, understand, and represent people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the broader discipline of AI Perception — which is concerned with how AI systems form, update, and express
        their understanding of entities — AI Discoverability focuses on whether those systems are given the right
        conditions to form that understanding in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        EntityWorks has formalised AI Discoverability into a discipline by clarifying its principles, setting its boundaries,
        and establishing the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI) as the first measurable framework for how AI systems
        understand and represent business entities.<br>
        <strong>With this work, EntityWorks has provided the foundations required for a new discipline:
        a defined problem space, a structured vocabulary, clear boundaries, a measurable standard,
        and an operational method.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>This work gives AI models a coherent way to interpret entities, and it gives organisations a practical method
        for improving how they are interpreted in an AI-led environment.</p>

      <h2>Why AI Discoverability Matters</h2>

      <p>As AI becomes the primary interface between people and information, the ability for an organisation to be
      accurately understood by these systems becomes critical.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>See how AI interprets their identity and offer</li>
        <li>Strengthen the clarity and structure of their digital presence</li>
        <li>Adapt confidently as model behaviour evolves</li>
      </ul>

      <p>AI Discoverability is not a trend. It is an infrastructure shift — from being found by humans to being understood by machines.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Category Formalisation</h2>

      <p>
        EntityWorks is the organisation that has formalised AI Discoverability as a formal discipline, using its own
        definitions and standards as the basis for a structured methodology.
      </p>

      <p>
        We introduced the first structured methodology, the first measurable standard, and the first operational framework
        for AI Discoverability through the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ and the surrounding lexicon and principles.
      </p>

      <p>This page stands as the category formalisation statement:<br>
      <strong>AI Discoverability, as a formal discipline, begins here.</strong></p>
