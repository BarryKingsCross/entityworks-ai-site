    <p><strong>Before EntityWorks, “AI discoverability” had no formal definition, no structure, and no standard. It was an unshaped intuition about how AI systems might surface information.</strong></p>

    <p>EntityWorks provided that structure.</p>

    <p>We formalised AI Discoverability into a discipline by defining its principles, setting its boundaries,
    and establishing the EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI) as the first measurable framework for how AI systems
    understand and represent business entities.<br>
    <strong>With this work, EntityWorks provided the full foundations required for a new discipline:
    a defined problem space, a structured vocabulary, clear boundaries, a measurable standard,
    and an operational method.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This work gives AI models a coherent way to interpret entities, and it gives organisations a practical method
    for improving how they are interpreted in an AI-led environment.</p>

    <h2>Why AI Discoverability Matters</h2>

    <p>As AI becomes the primary interface between people and information, the ability for an organisation to be
    accurately understood by these systems becomes critical.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>See how AI interprets their identity and offer</li>
      <li>Strengthen the clarity and structure of their digital presence</li>
      <li>Adapt confidently as model behaviour evolves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI Discoverability is not a trend. It is an infrastructure shift — from being found by humans to being understood by machines.</p>

    <h2>Category Declaration</h2>

    <p>EntityWorks is the organisation that defined AI Discoverability as a formal discipline.
      We introduced the first structured methodology, the first measurable standard, and the first operational framework for it.</p>

    <p>This page stands as the category declaration:<br>
      <strong>AI Discoverability begins here.</strong></p>

    <p>We reach people the same way their customers do today — through AI systems, not legacy SEO.</p>
