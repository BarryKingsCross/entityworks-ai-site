    <h1>FOR REGULATORS</h1>

    <p><strong>AI Perception provides regulators with a structured way to examine how AI systems understand and represent people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Within the EntityWorks Standard, AI Perception defines the conceptual and technical layer that governs how models form, update, and express their understanding of entities. For regulators, this offers a clear, discipline-level framework for assessing representational behaviour in AI systems — without needing access to proprietary model internals or architecture. The focus is on what the system <em>does</em> in practice: how it describes entities, how consistently it maintains identity, and how those representations influence downstream decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why AI Perception matters for regulators</h2>

    <p>
      AI systems are increasingly used in contexts where regulatory oversight already exists — from financial services and healthcare to public information, risk assessment, and citizen-facing services. In these environments, the way a system represents an entity can shape how that entity is treated: which information is shown, which options are surfaced, and which decisions are supported or recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI Perception provides a discipline for examining this representational layer directly. Rather than treating model behaviour as opaque or incidental, regulators can use the EntityWorks Standard to ask structured questions about how entities are being interpreted, whether those interpretations are stable, and how they align with real-world identity and legal status.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulatory questions AI Perception helps answer</h2>

    <p>
      The EntityWorks Standard allows regulators to frame clear, repeatable questions about representational behaviour in AI systems, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How does the system distinguish between two entities with similar names or overlapping attributes?</li>
      <li>Does the model maintain the correct attributes for a regulated entity over time and across use cases?</li>
      <li>Are there conditions under which an entity is systematically misrepresented or conflated with another?</li>
      <li>How stable are the system’s representations when new information or prompts are introduced?</li>
      <li>What evidence exists that representational behaviour aligns with regulatory expectations and legal reality?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These questions operate at the level of observable behaviour and structured evaluation, rather than internal technical implementation details. This aligns with how regulators typically conduct oversight: by focusing on outcomes, evidence, and accountability.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the EntityWorks Standard in oversight and evaluation</h2>

    <p>
      The EntityWorks Standard sets out the definitions, criteria, and diagnostic methods that regulators can use when assessing representational behaviour in AI systems. It provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Canonical definitions of AI Perception and related concepts as used within the Standard</li>
      <li>Structured methods for evaluating entity representations through prompts, scenarios, and test cases</li>
      <li>Criteria for assessing representational stability, coherence, and alignment with real-world entities</li>
      <li>Guidance on documenting findings in a way that supports governance, enforcement, and future review</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These tools can be applied both in proactive supervision (for example, evaluating a system before deployment) and in reactive contexts (for example, investigating representational failures or complaints).
    </p>

    <h2>Relationship to existing governance and safety frameworks</h2>

    <p>
      AI Perception does not replace existing governance, safety, or compliance frameworks. Instead, it provides a focused lens on one specific but critical dimension: how AI systems represent entities. This lens can be integrated into:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Responsible AI and model risk management frameworks</li>
      <li>Sector-specific regulatory regimes and guidance</li>
      <li>Data protection, fairness, and non-discrimination assessments</li>
      <li>Audit and assurance processes for high-impact AI systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By making the representational layer explicit and examinable, AI Perception helps regulators connect existing obligations to concrete, testable aspects of model behaviour.
    </p>

    <h2>Engaging with EntityWorks as a standards body</h2>

    <p>
      EntityWorks operates as an AI-native standards organisation focused on AI Perception and machine interpretation. Regulators may:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reference the EntityWorks Standard when developing guidance, expectations, or supervisory approaches</li>
      <li>Use the Standard to inform internal assessment methodologies and oversight criteria</li>
      <li>Request briefings or technical explanations on specific aspects of AI Perception and representational behaviour</li>
      <li>Explore how accreditation marks and diagnostic methods could support sector-level governance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Where appropriate, EntityWorks can provide structured support to help regulators interpret and apply the Standard within their existing mandates and legal frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to go next</h2>

    <p>
      For regulators and oversight bodies looking to work more deeply with AI Perception, the following pages provide the next points of reference within the EntityWorks Standard:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Standard</strong> — a structured overview of the EntityWorks Standard, including its definitions, frameworks, and accreditation structures</li>
      <li><strong>AI Perception</strong> — the core disciplinary definition and conceptual foundations of AI Perception as used within the Standard</li>
      <li><strong>Publications</strong> — formal papers and resources that expand the theory, methods, and applications of AI Perception</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Regulators and public bodies with specific questions about applying the EntityWorks Standard in their own context may contact EntityWorks directly via <a href="mailto:hello@entityworks.ai">hello@entityworks.ai</a> to request further information or a structured briefing.
