  <h2>1. From Principle to Practical Value</h2>
  <p>
    AI Discoverability describes how clearly an organisation may be understood by AI systems. The EntityWorks
    Discoverability Index™ (EDI) turns this into a measurable business tool, offering a structured way to understand how an
    organisation might appear inside AI models and where clarity could be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    The EDI is designed to help leaders:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>understand current AI-facing representation</li>
    <li>identify areas of improvement</li>
    <li>connect these improvements to commercial relevance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What the EDI Measures</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the EDI is simple:
  </p>
  <p><em>To provide a clear, interpretable view of how AI systems may understand an organisation.</em></p>

  <p>The EDI examines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — how clearly the organisation’s purpose and offering appear.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency</strong> — whether signals align across sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Coherence</strong> — whether the organisation forms a stable, intelligible picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Traceability</strong> — whether authoritative sources reinforce understanding.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural readiness</strong> — how well the digital presence supports AI interpretation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the EDI Links to Business Outcomes</h2>

  <h3>3.1. Improved Visibility in AI Journeys</h3>
  <p>
    Organisations with clearer signals may appear more often in relevant AI-generated outputs and be described with greater
    accuracy.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2. More Accurate Descriptions of What You Do</h3>
  <p>
    The EDI helps identify where AI systems may misunderstand, oversimplify, or omit key aspects of an organisation.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3. Stronger Category Positioning</h3>
  <p>
    Structural clarity may strengthen an organisation’s role within its category and differentiate it from competitors.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4. Reduced Visibility Friction</h3>
  <p>
    When AI representation is unclear, organisations often compensate through additional marketing spend. Improved structural
    clarity may reduce this reliance.
  </p>

  <h3>3.5. Improved Governance and Decision-Making</h3>
  <p>
    The EDI provides a measurable view that can support strategic decisions related to brand, digital structure, and AI
    readiness.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Who Benefits from the EDI</h2>

  <h3>4.1. Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    Leaders can use the EDI to understand AI-related visibility and inform long-term strategy.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2. Marketing and Brand Teams</h3>
  <p>
    Marketing teams can align messaging for AI as well as humans and understand which signals matter most.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3. Digital, Data, and Product Teams</h3>
  <p>
    Digital teams may use EDI insights to refine structured data, content design, and broader digital architecture.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4. Compliance and Risk Functions</h3>
  <p>
    Risk teams may monitor AI interpretations and identify potential issues early.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Why the EDI Is Recurring</h2>
  <p>
    AI systems evolve continuously. The EDI is most effective as a recurring measure to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>track progress</li>
    <li>identify interpretive shifts</li>
    <li>maintain long-term representational stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Why EntityWorks Is Positioned to Deliver the EDI</h2>
  <p>
    EntityWorks is well placed to deliver the EDI because it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>defined AI Discoverability as a discipline</li>
    <li>built the EDI as a principle-based model</li>
    <li>introduced the Entity Understanding Layer™</li>
    <li>publishes its work transparently</li>
    <li>records and timestamps key developments</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Conclusion — Making AI Discoverability Actionable</h2>
  <p>
    The EDI helps organisations answer a practical question:
  </p>
  <p><em>“How might AI systems understand our organisation, and what can we do to improve that understanding?”</em></p>
  <p>
    By turning AI Discoverability into a structured index, organisations gain clarity, resilience, and long-term advantage in
    an AI-interpreted world.
