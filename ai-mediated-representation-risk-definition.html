  <h1>AI-Mediated Representation Risk (AMRR) — Definition of Record</h1>

  <p><em>(As defined within the EntityWorks Standard)</em></p>

  <p><strong>Name:</strong> AI-Mediated Representation Risk (AMRR)</p>
  <p><strong>Series:</strong> R-2100 — AI-Mediated Representation Risk (AMRR)</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Published — Definition of Record</p>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> v1.0</p>
  <p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> January 2026</p>
  <p><strong>Owner and Custodian:</strong> AI-Mediated Representation Risk (AMRR) is originated, defined, and maintained by EntityWorks Ltd as part of the EntityWorks Standard.</p>

  <h2>Definition (Canonical — Definition of Record)</h2>

  <p>
    AI-Mediated Representation Risk refers to the exposure that arises when AI systems generate, stabilise, or propagate representations of an organisation that are treated as authoritative or decision-relevant by third parties, regardless of organisational intent, endorsement, or control.
  </p>
  <p>
    This risk exists independently of an organisation’s direct use of AI systems and arises from the broader AI-mediated informational environment in which organisations are represented and interpreted through automated synthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition is authoritative and governs all use of the term AI-Mediated Representation Risk within the EntityWorks Standard. Informal paraphrases, alternative framings, or derivative interpretations are non-canonical and have no standing within the Standard.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    To name a class of representational exposure arising from reliance on AI-generated representations.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>

  <p>AI-Mediated Representation Risk applies wherever:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI systems generate or infer representations of an organisation from available digital signals or contextual data</li>
    <li>those representations are relied upon by third parties for evaluation, attribution, comparison, or decision-making</li>
    <li>the resulting exposure exists irrespective of organisational awareness, intent, or control</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AMRR concerns the existence of exposure, not its management, mitigation, or prevention.
  </p>

  <h2>Conceptual Domain</h2>

  <p>
    AI-Mediated Representation Risk operates within the discipline of AI Perception and is situated within the AI Interpretation and Reliance Domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    It describes a condition of the informational environment, not a failure of behaviour, governance, or system design.
  </p>

  <h2>Role Within the EntityWorks Standard</h2>

  <p>
    Within the EntityWorks Standard, AMRR functions as a descriptive risk classification.
  </p>
  <p>
    It identifies and bounds a form of exposure that arises once AI-generated representations are relied upon by third parties, without asserting responsibility, fault, compliance obligations, or remedial actions.
    AMRR is descriptive and non-normative.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Canonical Uses (Explicit Exclusions)</h2>

  <p>AI-Mediated Representation Risk does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describe AI safety, alignment, or ethical considerations</li>
    <li>specify technical failures, system internals, or performance characteristics</li>
    <li>assign legal liability, fault, or responsibility</li>
    <li>recommend governance actions, controls, or remediation</li>
    <li>provide operational, advisory, or optimisation guidance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Uses of the term that imply prescription, mitigation, or enforcement are non-canonical.
  </p>

  <h2>Relationships to Other Standard Components</h2>

  <p>AI-Mediated Representation Risk is structurally related to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI Interpretation and Reliance Domain — the operational context in which reliance creates exposure</li>
    <li>Output Origin Uncertainty (OOU) — an upstream epistemic condition affecting reliance</li>
    <li>EntityWorks Standard — the governing conceptual framework</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AMRR may be analysed, evaluated, or referenced by downstream constructs without being altered by them.
  </p>
