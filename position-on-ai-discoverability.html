      <h2>The core shift</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks’ position is simple: as AI systems mediate more of how people discover and evaluate businesses,
        organisations must optimise not just for people, but for how AI systems understand them.
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        <strong>We reach people the same way your customers do today — through AI systems, not legacy SEO.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI Discoverability vs legacy SEO</h2>
      <p>
        We do not view AI Discoverability as a replacement for all existing channels. Instead, we see it as a
        structural layer that sits underneath them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SEO focuses on ranking pages in search results.</li>
        <li>AI Discoverability focuses on how AI systems interpret, represent, and surface your entity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both can matter in parallel. But as AI assistants and summarisation layers become the default interface,
        we believe AI Discoverability will become the primary determinant of whether your organisation is visible at all.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why we built the EDI and EUL</h2>
      <p>
        To support this transition, EntityWorks publishes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/discoverability-index.html">EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</a> – a 0–100 framework measuring AI readiness and machine identity clarity.</li>
        <li>The <a href="/entity-understanding-layer.html">Entity Understanding Layer™ (EUL)</a> – an interpretive model for how AI systems appear to build internal entity understanding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these allow leaders to see AI Discoverability not as a vague buzzword, but as a tangible,
        measurable, and improvable aspect of their digital presence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our stance on claims and limits</h2>
      <p>
        We are explicit about what we are and are not claiming. EntityWorks does not claim access to proprietary
        model internals or vendor-specific code paths. Our work is based on publicly observable behaviour, public
        documentation, and practical experience with AI-powered systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our role is to provide structure, language, and standards – not to overstate certainty about how any single
        model operates internally.
