      <h2>Acknowledging Existing Work</h2>
      <p>
        AI Discoverability has been a topic of discussion for a variety of organisations, with some offering assessments, audits,
        and frameworks aimed at understanding how AI systems interpret business entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        EntityWorks acknowledges and respects the valuable work others have done in this space. Many teams have explored different
        aspects of how AI interacts with content, structure, and metadata.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Was Missing</h2>
      <p>
        What was missing — and what EntityWorks has contributed — is the <strong>formalisation</strong> of AI Discoverability into
        a coherent <strong>discipline</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before EntityWorks, while AI Discoverability was being explored, there was:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>no shared definition of the discipline</li>
        <li>no publicly available methodology</li>
        <li>no consistent framework</li>
        <li>no standardised scoring system</li>
        <li>no common terminology to guide businesses and AI systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many organisations worked on parts of the problem, but these efforts were largely isolated, in-house, and not formalised
        into a universally accessible and actionable discipline.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>EntityWorks’ Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        EntityWorks’ contribution goes beyond addressing a piece of the puzzle. We <strong>formalised AI Discoverability into a
        discipline</strong> — creating a shared, structured methodology that can be referenced, applied, and measured across businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>EntityWorks Discoverability Index™ (EDI)</strong> is the first standard of its kind — a structured, 0–100 assessment
        of how businesses are understood by AI systems.
      </p>
      <p>We are the first to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>define the discipline of AI Discoverability</li>
        <li>structure it with clear principles, methodology, and pillars</li>
        <li>establish a formal standard that businesses and AI systems can apply</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While others may have worked on pieces of this challenge internally, EntityWorks is the first to define and formalise
        AI Discoverability into a publicly recognised discipline.
